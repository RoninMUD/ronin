 o  This space will no longer list our most important rules,
    instead it will be used to give important messages about
    our world.  However, players are expected to type 
    HELP INFORMATION and use the help files to familiarize
    themselves with our policies.

 o  As always, check the altar board and newspaper for any
    recent changes or updates.

 o  We have been running with a 50 level system since April 99.
    If this is your first time back since the change, all of
    your xp has been set to 0.
