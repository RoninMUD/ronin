La Soudure~
   The waters of La Soudure run very deep here.  As you peer into the crystal
waters, you see flashes of sunlight glinting off the sides of various marine
animals. You try to see the bottom, but all you can make out is a deep blue
hue. The waves roll gently here, inducing you into a hypnotic state of peace
and tranquility.

Plane of Horrors~
 An endless field of indistinguishable landscape stretches out in each of the
cardinal directions. Giant, withered stalks of a brambly, corn-like plant are
the dominant feature of the otherwise desolate plane. It is dark here in an
eerie way, as if the whole place is frozen in pre-dawn, safe from the healing
and rejuvenating spirit of the sun. Somehow the air is both oppressively hot
and frigidly cold; a strange amalgam of the desert and arctic climates in the
plane from whence you came. All this serves to demonstrate one thing: this is
not a natural place. Crafted by some dark being, this plane of existence has
been cut off from the natural world either by design or by force. But now you
have found your way here and can only pray that your gods serve you well as
you battle the denizens of this cursed place.

the dominant feature of the otherwise desolate plane. It is dark here in an
eerie way, as if the whole place is frozen in pre-dawn, safe from the healing
and rejuvenating spirit of the sun. Somehow the air is both oppressively hot
and frigidly cold; a strange amalgam of the desert and arctic climates in the
plane from whence you came. All this serves to demonstrate one thing: this is
not a natural place. Crafted by some dark being, this plane of existence has
been cut off from the natural world either by design or by force. But now you
have found your way here and can only pray that your gods serve you well as
you battle the denizens of this cursed place.

cardinal directions. Giant, withered stalks of a brambly, corn-like plant are
the dominant feature of the otherwise desolate plane. It is dark here in an
eerie way, as if the whole place is frozen in pre-dawn, safe from the healing
and rejuvenating spirit of the sun. Somehow the air is both oppressively hot
and frigidly cold; a strange amalgam of the desert and arctic climates in the
plane from whence you came. All this serves to demonstrate one thing: this is
not a natural place. Crafted by some dark being, this plane of existence has
been cut off from the natural world either by design or by force. But now you
have found your way here and can only pray that your gods serve you well as
you battle the denizens of this cursed place.

Plane of Horrors~
 An endless field of indistinguishable landscape stretches out in each of the
cardinal directions. Giant, withered stalks of a brambly, corn-like plant are
the dominant feature of the otherwise desolate plane. It is dark here in an
eerie way, as if the whole place is frozen in pre-dawn, safe from the healing
and rejuvenating spirit of the sun. Somehow the air is both oppressively hot
and frigidly cold; a strange amalgam of the desert and arctic climates in the
plane from whence you came. All this serves to demonstrate one thing: this is
not a natural place. Crafted by some dark being, this plane of existence has
been cut off from the natural world either by design or by force. But now you
have found your way here and can only pray that your gods serve you well as
you battle the denizens of this cursed place.

Hall of Kludges~
Scattered everywhere, willy nilly, are lots of strange gadgets that
apparently do nothing. A sign on the wall catches your attention.
