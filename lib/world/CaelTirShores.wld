The Broken Dock~
The remains of a wooden dock stretch out over the surf, several
planks missing and others lashed together with rope and desperation.
Waves slap against the supports below, causing the entire structure
to groan with each swell. Crates and loose boards lie scattered
about, evidence of a hurried and imperfect landing. From here, the 
island rises inland, its dense tree line watching in silence.

Dockside Supply Pile~
Stacks of weathered crates and bundled supplies have been dragged
just far enough from the water to stay dry. Tarps flap loudly in
the sea wind, barely secured with stones and rope. Some containers
are clearly marked for construction, while others remain 
unopened, as if no one dares inventory them yet.

Expedition Camp~
A loose ring of tents and makeshift shelters forms the heart of the
expedition. Cookfires smolder low, and the air smells of 
smoke, salt, and damp canvas. Voices rise and fall in tired
conversation, punctuated by the clink of tools and the scrape of
boots on packed sand.

The Shallow Shore~
Wet sand stretches along the waterline, littered with driftwood 
and sea-tossed debris. The tide pulls rhythmically at the
shoreline, exposing dark shapes beneath the foam before claiming
them again. The island feels close here, its presence pressing
inward from the jungle beyond the beach.

The Rocky Strand~
Jagged stone dominates this stretch of coast, forming uneven footing
and shallow tide pools. Pale mineral veins run through the
rocks, catching the light when the waves retreat. The sound of surf

Camp Outskirts~
The ordered chaos of the camp begins to thin here. Broken tools and
discarded crates lie half-buried in the sand, abandoned rather than
lost. Beyond this point, the land grows less forgiving, and the 
sense of shelter fades quickly.

Dense vegetation presses close, leaves broad and heavy with moisture.
The air is warmer here, thick with the scent of earth and growing
things. Vines coil around rocks and fallen branches, and the shadows

A narrow trail cuts into the jungle, hacked open by blades and

Fallen Surveyors Clearing~
This small clearing bears the marks of a failed effort to impose order.
Wooden stakes lie snapped or pulled from the ground, and a collapsed
tripod rests near a scatter of abandoned tools. Whatever measurements
were taken here were never finished.

Split Canopy Path~
Here the jungle path divides, neither route clearly safer than the
other. Overhead, the canopy thickens, blocking much of the light
and casting the ground below in shifting shadow. The air is
unnaturally still, as if the forest itself is waiting.

A simple wooden post stands here, leaning at an angle. Faded markings

The Breathing Grove~
Tall plants ring this enclosed grove, their broad leaves rising and
falling gently despite the lack of wind. The ground is soft
underfoot, almost spongy, and the air feels warmer than it should. 
Nothing openly threatens you here but the island is paying attention.

The Verdant Threshold~
A curtain of intertwined vines and broad-leafed growth blocks the
path forward, forming a living wall that rises from the forest floor
to the canopy above. As you approach, the vegetation shifts 
subtly, parting only slightly before settling back into place. The 
air here is heavy with warmth and the slow rhythm of breathing plants.

Beyond the living barrier, the ground dips into a narrow passage
formed entirely of massive, exposed roots. They arch overhead like
ribs, their surfaces smooth from ages of slow movement. A faint
pulse can be felt through the soles of your feet, steady 
and deliberate.

from the land itself.
