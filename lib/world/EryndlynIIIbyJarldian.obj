pile~
You have come upon a pile of corpses resembling gnomes.  The seemed to be
deliberately stacked up for some reason, however, you can see no purpose of it
other than to mock.  Blood is all over the place, smeared on the walls, and
all over the cavern ground.  Fingers and limbs are spread on the floor, with
one noticeable decapitated head.  The stench here is unbearable and you just
wonder who would ever commit such a cruel act and show no mercy.

tree~
This ancient tree has been growing for centuries, and it does not appear
to show signs of wear.  It must stand to be about 45 feet high in the air and
has a fine layer of bark that has protected the tree for so long.  This tree
is the silent watcher of all that happens here, neither doing nor acting in
favor in any side.  It has witnessed much and will do so for many more 
centuries to come.

The expression on this svirfneblin's face is of absolute terror.  His throat
is ripped open, blood pouring out onto the ground, and his skin -- cold to the
touch. Multiple cuts are all over his body, suggesting a powerful foe
