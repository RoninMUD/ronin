   Christmas NEEDS!
2 Rolls of wrapping paper
2 Christmas Cards
2 Rolls of tape
1 Gift for a boy
1 Gift for a girl
  The elves have stolen everything! They were swallowing toys
and drinking the special eggnog! I'm terrified to set foot outside
my sanctuary now. Please destroy them by whatever means you can
and TEAR them APART looking for my toys! Christmas can still be
saved, do your part and bring me the items I so desperately need
in time to deliver them around the world.
   Oh and umm, watch out for Mrs. Clause, I think something snapped
inside her, she's a little more fiesty then usual.
Merry? Christmas,
   -Santa
