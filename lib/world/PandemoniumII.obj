sword~
   This blade is ancient and has served in countless battles over
the centuries. Within it is contained all the knowledge of the
warriors that wielded it before. Just a tenth of that knowledge
would make a warrior nearly unbeatable in combat, but you
have to wonder if a mortal minds could handle that much knowledge.

kabuto helmet~
This red helmet once belonged to a mighty samurai, but has
since been forever tainted by a spirit of the underworld.
It retains all of its former power, but its taint is likely
to weaken the body of anyone who wears it.
