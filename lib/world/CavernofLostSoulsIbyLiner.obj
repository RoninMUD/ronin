   Look not to simple conventions, for all directions bend to
our will.  Upon this, your torture is imminent.

  It appears to be a large ring of hardening clay.  Speckles of
blood adorn the band which encircles a ghastly symbol depicting a
human form nailed to a crosstree.  Shrouds and shackles dangle
from either side of the large T-shape.  This is the Seal of Tajjo,
the eater of souls.  A tiny inscription lines the inner circle.
