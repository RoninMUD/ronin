opal ice~
Ice opals are a rare and precious stone found only in frozen wastelands and
buried deep within the earth.  The mostly-white stones are usually small in
size but naturally round and smooth, almost like a pearl.  Colored flecks of
material sparkle with a dull metallic glint from beneath the shiny surface.

it grew.  The crystal is a light aqua-blue color similar to the frozen water
that makes up the glaciers where they can be found.  The crystal is about six
centimeters long and one centimeter thick.

dried blood can be seen on the back side of it, as well as the severed
attachment point where it used to connect to the parent creature.  Though the
material seems to be decaying slowly, it still radiates some sort of other-
worldly power which might be harnessed by its wearer.

blood vial green basilisk potion~
The substance within this bottle is not actually a potion, but the blood of a
fearsome beast.  Basilisk blood contains properties of protection which it
normally bestows upon the creature that produces it.  When swallowed by
another, these same properties can be given to that person, though the effects
are only temporary and will wear off in time.  It is often wondered if the
dangers involved in harvesting this rare substance is worth the benefits, and
yet a select few will risk the endeavor.
