broken shield tower~
At some point during the process of murdering its former
owner, this shield was cleaved in two. Remarkably, due to
the high quality construction of the original shield, this
piece looks like it can still somehow be of use.   Perhaps
you can repair it somehow.

shield heroes~
You have restored the shield, but sadly the art of making this
shield has been lost forever. It will not be long before this
shield is dust.
But until then, be a mighty warrior and slay all evil!
The shield is a large tower shield and gives great protection.
On the upper part of the shield the mighty Wywern soars in the
sky over a dark landscape filled with evil creatures.
