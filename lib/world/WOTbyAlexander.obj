broken shield~
The shield was once a powerful shield, but the years have taken
its toll, and the shield needs to be remade. Maybe you can be the
one to remake it and wield its former might?

shield heroes~
You have restored the shield, but sadly the art of making this
shield has been lost forever. It will not be long before this
shield is dust.
But until then, be a mighty warrior and slay all evil!
The shield is a large tower shield and gives great protection.
On the upper part of the shield the mighty Wywern soars in the
sky over a dark landscape filled with evil creatures.

portal~
The portal is made of some unknown material, and it's formed like a rounded 
rectangle wide enough for 2-3 people to enter at the same time. A serpent curls
around the rim of the portal, biting its own tail. It's know that some consider
this symbol of symbolising the eternal spinning of the Wheel Of Time, a once
fabeled world lost in the winds of time.
