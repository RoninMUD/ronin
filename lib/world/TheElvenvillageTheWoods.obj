You accidentally open the huge tome and spot the following passage ...

     "... Since the time began, there has been Evil in the world. Many
fiends and the like have been after the souls of men. Finally, the great
nations of elves and the four elemental powers existing combined their might 
to imprison a Demon of Great Evil. They divided their responsibility of it's
safekeeping among themselves. The four keys were dispersed all over the planes,
to the keeping of elemental masters, while the prison itself was to be guarded
by our ancestors. The only sign of the prison is a huge golden door, locked
by means unavailable in our world ... "

A strange gust of wind clams the book shut.

           Hold your head up high, even below the land and stone,
                with the helmet of diamonds protecting you.

           Burn away the harmful gases with the burning iron,
                  for inhaling them will be fatal.

           Do not eat the flower of water that is not in water,
           for when in water, it will be much more vitalizing.

                You see the shining orb they call a pearl,
                    from the depths of the sea
    to protect you with it's inner coolness and strength from the heat.

             Your journey will take you through many worlds,
       from fiery flames into the stone. From there, you will find
        yourself immersed in water, with helpful air on it's way.
               The starting point is within the circle.
                 There is always a way back, to home.

There are also some symbols on the amulet:     ù

                                               ∫

venom which drips from the needle's tip when you flex your knuckles.
