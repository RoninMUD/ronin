arch great mighty~
This is a mighty arch indeed, constructed for the great Lord Emithoynarthe who
ruled these lands in a time unknown.  It is inscribed with many beautiful
carvings and words written in an ancient language that is all but forgotten in
this world.  The Great Arch marks the entrance to Emithoynarthe's Realm and is
an icon of his power.  Only the brave or the foolish would dare pass beneath it
and into the lands beyond.  At the base of one of the supporting columns a
small aperture can be seen.

A small aperture can be seen at the base of one of the supporting columns of
The Great Arch.  It looks to be just the right shape and size to store a

oar wooden rotten~
This is a small wooden oar that has seen better days in a time long forgotten.
The once-fine wood has been bleached with age and parts of it have begun to rot
away.  It looks to have been left here for a good many years since it was last
used.  It is doubtful that it would survive any extended use as a paddle in
water.

throne bones flesh~
The throne is constructed of many bleached-white bones, possibly once belonging
to humans.  Carvings adorn every square inch of the structure but are worn and
faded and in a language long forgotten.  The bones flicker in a crimson light
that burns out of a fire placed behind the chair.  This is the holy throne of
the Great Lord of Emithoynarthe, one of the ancient kings of the Old World and
possibly the last of that old order.  The throne does not look very comfortable
and does not seem to be used very often.

book black tower emithoynarthe~
The book is crafted from a deep-black leather that is dusted and cracked with
age.  It has several inscriptions written upon it in a language that once was
used in the lands of its origin.  A closer look at it reveals the words to be
written in gold leaf, though the exact designs are unclear because of the worn
nature of the tome.
It looks like page1 and page2 contain very important parts of the book.
~
E
page1~
These lands are ruled by the mighty Emithoynarthe, the great king of old who is
one of the survivors of the downfall of this once-great empire.  He now lives
alone in his great house to the west, viewable through the fixed telescope I
have placed in my tower.  He values his privacy above all things and has a
grand guard that defends his residence with his life.  If any were to get past
the guard, Emithoynarthe himself would rain his wrath upon the intruders and
stamp out their pitiful lives for sure.  None shall live here that do not
submit themselves to His absolute rulership, for his reign is a terrible one
that cannot be denied.  It is not advisable to go against His wishes when
within this Empire, for to do so would be to invite death.
~
E
page2~
The prophecies tell of a time to come when this land shall once more exist in
its former splendor.  The Empire shall grow from these forests and the mighty
King Emithoynarthe shall once again rule all that exist within His realm.  For
the current Lord Emithoynarthe is the son of the first Imperial that came to
this land and built it into the Grand Empire of the Golden Age.  In this first
age all was good until the Old King was deceived by one of his own followers
and was forced to give his life to save his empire.  His son, Emithoynarthe
took over the rulership but the Kingdom crumbled and he is now among the few
that remain.  He lives here still, as he has for ages, sitting on his throne
awaiting the day that His Empire will rise again.  Here He shall remain for
ages to come, watching and waiting for His time to rule again.  All should fear
the Mighty Emithoynarthe, for He is great and it is folly to underestimate the
powers he exerts over His land.

have no reason to stay within this realm, leave now or feel the wrath of the
Lord Emithoynarthe as he banishes you from this glorious land."

It once belonged to a pirate that died in captivity and now haunts the ship of

some of the powers of the dead.

made them was a master of the glove-making craft.
