Da Doobies' House of Hemp~
This is the safe haven for the members of the Da Doobies clan, where the
members come to relax and enjoy themselves.  You are astounded by the
appearance of the room.  Everything seems to be made of hemp...it's as if
the whole room was one gigantic bud!  Plants grow all over the walls and
furniture of this smoke filled heaven.  Sliteyed, You wander aimlessly
around the room carefully examining everything you come upon. A collection
of pipes and bongs of all different shapes and sizes lie on the table next
to a bowl full of munchies. The walls are decorated with a psychadelic
painting continuing endlessly throughout the whole room. A comfy looking
sofa with feathery pillows has been placed in the centre of the room around
a large wooden table.  In one of the corners of the room is a small cooling
cabinet filled with refreshments and munchies to soothen that dry mouth after
a good session.  Inhailing the smoke you feel completely at ease in this room
of tranquility and wonder, why anyone would ever want to leave.

Inside the Iron Tower of Diabolik~
   You stand inside a vast cylindrical structure made entirely of one 
piece of solid iron. Torchlight eerily plays about the walls and many 
tapestries that adorn the walls creating flittering shadows that jump 
about the walls almost as if they were alive.  A dark sense of forboding 
grips your chest as footfalls echo throughout the chamber, reverberating
endlessly off the thick walls.

A Crystal-Domed Armory~
   You are inside a massively constructed vault and armory complex, weapons
and armors the like of which you've never seen line the walls in special 
racks, many of them glowing with mystical dweomers.  The crystal dome 
overhead also appears to me quite magical in nature, its facets breaking 
up the sunlight into tiny rainbows as you look at it. As the massive vault 
door thuds shut behind you, you feel somewhat safe even though there's a 
brute of a guard who'll kill you in a heartbeat if you dont belong here.

The Rusty Sword~
  As you top the stairs, your eyes behold a wondrous sight. Before you is a
large hall filled with long tables that are surrounded by comfortable chairs.
The Hall's walls are covered with the banners of each individual clan that 
makes up the entirety of Diabolik. The floor is made of solid, well-worn oak
that has been stained by ale being repeatedly spilled on its surface by
joyful members of the elite club. The pillars holding up the roof are shaped
like giant swords. They are made of solid iron and, as a result, are slightly 
rusting from years of exposure. It is obvious where the name for this famous 
tavern came from.  On top of each table are places set with the names of 
Diabolik Members in front of each. Around the fireplaces, there are more chairs
drawn together so that these professional killers can share tales of the
adventures with one another. On one side of the hall is a bar, behind which 
are several shelves lined with every alcoholic beverage you could imagine... 
and some beyond your imagination. Thick oaken stairs wind around the
circumference of the room, leading down and also up to yet another level.

honor the clans from which a great many of our members hailed from.
Amongst the many banners you see A totally black flag which must belong to
DARK, another right beside it bearing a shield crossed with a sword, spear
and mace with the word HELLIONS emblazoned beneath it, another with a
clenched fist which belongs to DAMAGE INC, and finally a simply designed
banner bearing a shield with the letters LV upon it. On the other side of 
the room, nearly out of view, is tacked an unusual looking yellow and red 
banner with a 5 leafed plant as its emblem.

Diabolik Room of Ancient Knowledge~
   You stand inside a vast libram of ancient texts, many of which scrawled
in tongues which you havent the slightest grasp of understanding. The shelves 
reach far far above you, nearly three times your height they stretch until
they finally abut a metal ceiling. On a great many of the shelves tomes, 
scrolls and other works radiate soft auras, giving away at least a tiny hint 
of their arcane nature.

threatened.  The flames will harm no one that belongs, yet will do
sustainable damage to those who do not. A hooded receptionist stands
before the flaming opening, head hidden underneath his guise, and slightly
tilted as if he was staring at the floor.  He motions his hands in your
direction as if he were trying to get your to come closer.

the walls, all from slashing to piercing types.  Also hung on the walls
are heads of the various mobs killed in battle, ranging from the Queen
Ant, the Warden, and Dagoor.  Looking far across the room is a marble
mantle, with pictures of Diabolik members and a huge crest of the Diabolik
Clan.  A training dummy stands meekly in the center of the training hall,
cringing away from your approach.

The Gateway to Hell~
   A powerful force pulls you towards the whirling vortex in the center of
this incredibly hot cavern.  A large pentagram has been crudely etched into
the floor, still wet with fresh blood.  The smells of sulfur, fire, and
brimstone are strong here, suggesting that the vortex is a one way ticket 
to the dominions of the devils, succubi, and incubi who are lazily lounging
about, beckoning with leering grins and half bare bodies shiny with sweat.

   Thin wisps of smoke curl up from the floorboards, casting everything
into a heated haze of incense, blood, and heavy perfume.  All along the
walls, glowing red coals hiss and crackle, as if possessed with a life of
their own.  The floor curves slightly downwards, towards the bubbling lava
spring in the center of the antechamber, where buxom succubi and naughty
incubi are sporting away, in full view.  The tantalizing smell of sizzling
bacon and the scattered bits of clothing strewn all about the chamber 
suggest that this is the place to be.

The Cavern of Tantalus~
   Wavering shadows are created by the flickering torches that line the
walls of this dank and gloomy cavern.  The sound of slowly dripping water
is maddening, more so in the otherwise inpenetrable silence.  A small,
dirty pool of water has formed in the center of the cavern, in which
stands the man fated to suffer forever hunger and thirst for presenting
before the immortals a feast made from his butchered son's meat.  Rumors
have it that Sumo enjoyed the feast even more so after thus learning of
Tantalus' treachery, but the congression of immortals had to teach the
rest of the mortals some respect for the gods and thus, punished Tantalus
accordingly.  All legends speak of Tantalus and his inability to neither
drink a single drop of water nor eat the smallest morsel.  As can be seen
though, he lives the life of relative luxury, only wetting his feet now
and then for appearances' sake.

The Boudoir~
   A faint breeze blows softly into the room, gently stirring the black
silk veils on the quaint victorian bed.  A tarnished bowl of sandalwood
burns into the wee hours of the night, casting lazy curls of perfumed
smoke into the air. In one corner of the chamber lies a wash basin, filled
with rose petals from sweeter days.  The air is still, except for the
strains of a classical harpsicord whose source is yet undetermined.
Over the bed, a magically suspended black pearl softly illuminates the
chamber, and you see a beautifully carved crest which proudly bears the
likeness of the Grand Lady Vampiress, Lakhena.

pleasure...  Shackles and rusted forks line the wall, basic instruments for

haze fills the air and assaults the senses. This hidden lounge resides in
the northern spire of Midgaard, above the Big Chain. Few have been accepted
into this hallowed tower and that suits the residents just fine. A wrought-
iron spiral staircase leads upward and a light breeze from the gardens to
the north helps ventilate the smoky surroundings.

a thin handrail creeping upwards alongside a stone walkway that spirals
around the vast circumference of the room. Spread along the path are vaguely
noticeable doorways, embedded into the perfectly smooth slate, only marked
by a silvery outline that blends into the texture of the walls. Recasting
your sight onto the towering tree that dominates the hall, you realize, much
to your embarrassment, that it is indeed not a tree, but an ent; not only
that, but the last entwife, the sole remaining paragon of its kind.

You stare in awe at the intensity of the room.  The walls are 
made of pure black ebon.  Curtains leading to your private chambers
line the east and west ends of the room.  Ornate tapestrys of past 
adventures adorn the walls, hanging in solemn beauty.  They tell the
tales of the heroic Legioneers who dared risk their lives destroying
the feared monsters of Ronin.  You gaze up at a crystal chandalier 
hanging from the oaken ceiling.  It covers the room in an eerie dark
light. The room is also glowing with strange candles that burn with 
blue flame.  Chills run down your spine as you hear your footsteps 
echoing off the castle walls.  Though this is your home, you still 
get a strange feeling of fear burning within your soul.

   You enter into the Grand Conservatory of this tremendous castle.
Ancient paintings and tapestrys hang from the walls and a beautiful
mural of ancient gods adorn the ceiling.  As you look from painting
to painting you get a glimpse into the past and it is as if you had
just revisited each time in a flashback.  Huge torches burn a bright 
blue flame in each of the corners, they cast an eerie glow on the
strange statues of demons and people that are cast into alcoves along 
the walls.  You recognize some of the faces on the statues to be that 
of your own.  A fireplace burns brightly on the north end of the room, 
though the fire rages you feel no heat eminating from it.  However, the
room is not cold at all.  With each footstep you take it feels as if for
a moment you are in a different world, revisiting the past places that
are depicted on the paintings.  The magic at work here is obviously very
powerful. The entry hall is to the south, to the east you hear a strange
bubbling noise, and to the west is the clanging of weapons and metals.

three of the walls here.  On each shelf there is hundreds of magic
beakers and various tubes and magic utensils.  Odd bags of unknown
substances line the floor and the room is quite a mess.  A strange
mist hangs heavy about the room.  The mist does not however block
your view of the room, it just creates an eerie atmosphere.  There
is a large stone counter in the centre of the room, and behind it
stirring a strange mixture in her cauldron is the old witch Greedle.
She glares up at you with her milky white eyes and smiles.  This 
would be a good place to pick up some supplies that Greedle may have

Legion have used in battle.  This is a room of war, and there
are some ancient artifacts adorning the room.  These artifacts are
old motheds of protection and destroying the Legion has used in the past
to defeat and destroy their enemies.  Some of these chaos and torture
devices scare you as you look at them.  Just picturing yourself in one
of them causes you to cringe in fear.  You can only imagine the horror
some of your enemies faced as the Legion captured and destroyed them.  
Huge metals vaults adorn the walls here, this is where the Dark Legion
stores its extra items of value.  Raven, the guardian of this room is 
here mending and testing the weapons that need to be fixed, she glances
up at you and welcomes you to enter.  This would be a good place to 
lighten your load and hand some of your things over to Raven.

The view here is breathtakingly beautiful.  You can see all over
the forest and the snow capped Helventia mountains.  The glorious
rivers and valleys of the woods long beneath you.  Far off in the
distance you can even make out the temple in town.  As you gaze
out over the country you can see the various wildlife taking care
of business, the rabbits hopping around, chewing on leaves, you
see foxes playing in a meadow, and a wonderous Elk jumping through
its domain.  From here you truly appreciate the beauty of nature.
The Legion has used this room in mental and physical training.  
The Legion always had respect for nature and its powers, and 
sometimes nature has been used by the Legion to channel their
powers. In this room you feel at peace, and in touch with yourself
and your environment.

   You follow the staircase into this dark and powerful room.  This is
the Altar of Sacrifice, where the Legion gives offerings and prayers
to the gods.  The room is lit by more blue flames and there are 
various torches and candleabras adorning the room.  On the north wall
there is the actualy altar of the gods.  It is tremendous in size
and is adorned with candles, and treasures.  Carved into the dark
structure are the faces of angels and demons, thier faces twisted into
positions of agony.  This symbolizes the power of the gods.  As you 
gaze up you find that this room has no ceiling, but it is a twisting
portal of blue, violet, and pink clouds in a swirling mass.  You see
the outline of spirits flying amidst the mass, they are chanting and
moaning softly.  You can feel the power in this room, and it seems to
be adding to your own.  You feel yourself being restored and your magic
powers are coming back to you, your body surges with the power of your
gods. A black liquid flows from the altar.  This is the blood of the
Legion.

you have ever seen.  As you approach the front desk you are
immediately greeted by two of the most gorgeous twins you have
ever seen.  The eastern wall of the lobby proudly displays photos
of many of the famous people who have stayed here, including
Hugh Hefner.  Hugh is quoted as saying, "Hotel Newbie is my home
away from the mansion".  How can you not like this place?

The Newbie Lounge~
  You heave a sigh of relief at the familiar surroundings of the Newbie Lounge.
As you gaze around this immense room, you begin to wonder why you ever leave it
at all.  The private quarters are arranged neatly to the west, while the open
bar occupies the northern side.  The remaining southern section houses the
entertainment.

  As you glance around the room you are stunned to note that the walls are
made of an unknown alloy.  Knocking on the wall only produces a dull thud,
denoting great thickness.  This might be the most secure room you have ever
been in.  Of course having Grunthor protecting the outer rooms can't hurt.

  This is a narrow side-path that leads off the Northern Trail and
into the dense woods that surround it.  From the main trail this path
didn't look like much of anything, but from here you can see that it
does appear to lead on for a bit.  The path leads deeper into the forest
to the West, or back to the Northern Trail to the East.

  You have entered the Newbie Atrium. This room is unlike anything
you have ever seen before. Besides the sheer size, there is a glass
domed ceiling that allows sunlight to stream in and fill every corner.
The plant life that is on display has been brought in from every
corner of the known world. There are benches discreetly placed along
each of the many walkways that allow for private contemplation.

Newbie Essentials~
   You gaze around the small square shack with wonder and amazement.
How can Sharak cram such enormous quantities in such a small space?
As your eyes wander from wall to wall you realize that there is
nothing you could possibly want that isn't neatly tucked away on a
shelf or dangling from a wall.  The only problem is that ol'Sharak
here is a full-blooded dwarf and he just loves to hoard.
Consequently, he only offers what he's willing to give up at the
time and those items are usually overstocked or leftovers from
his other ventures.

Instruction Room~
  Wandering to the west you find yourself in a large room with ancient looking
swords hung on the northern wall.  To the west, covering the entire wall hangs
the massive clan emblem.  Seemingly appearing out on nowhere a man stands next
to you with a beautifully made sword hanging from his belt and an aura of power
around him.  He stares at you for a moment with a startling intensity as if
peering into the depths of your soul searching for your weaknesses.  He then
informs you that he is the Chief Instructor of this fine clan and asks if you
would like a lesson in real fighting.  You can head east, the way you came
or you can stay and learn a thing or two.

   This is the most tranquil room you can imagine.  The ground is covered in
soft, lush grass, while small fluffy white clouds float overhead in a sky
of staggering blue.  The warm sun radiates down, with only the slightest
breeze brushing against your skin.  This is a place you could imagine
spending a lifetime, laying back, closing your eyes, and letting all the
troubles of the outside world fade away.  Here there is no war, no battles
to be won, no tormented souls screaming for release.  Here there is only
a peace far deeper than any you have ever known.

The Mud Orbits Around Our Massive Domination~
   Like a mother mercifully smothering her wounded child with a down pillow, we
suffocate the mud in truth til the last molecule of oxygenic falseness
dissipates and renders it helpless to our dominance. Overwhelmed by unibeauty,
the mud gushes with consent to follow our superior path, gently brushing our
tails when we allow it and dreaming of touching our gorgeous horns til we
unleash a flurry of hoven glory on its inadequate torso to punish such impure
thoughts. Yet never do we rule by force. We rule by eager consent from the
subpar other. The subaltern can speak, but only when spoken to. This is our
stable, and we fly over the fences. Resistance is senseless.

of all shapes and sizes filling in the gaps.  The strangest artifacts can be
seen jutting up from the heap, from sceptres and crowns to key-rings holding
fifty or more keys to mounds of cloaks five feet high.  There is a certain
kind of peace you feel, surrounded by such an opulent display of wealth.  It
cannot be doubted that whoever lives here is a collector for the sake of
collecting, and you feel certain that were you to take a little memento, it
would not be punished.  Portals cover the walls, the floor, and the ceiling,
each shimmering with a thousand colors, and showing a glimpse of a strange
scene in the world beyond.

Before the gates of Brethil Tham, the Birch Fortress~
  Standing before two huge mithril gates you cannot help but wonder
who built the magnificent fortress beyond.  The walls surrounding
the entire premise consists of many tall and strong oak trees,
intertwined with thick bramble bush.  The sun twinkles in the
silvery mithril and blinds you for a split Second as you focus your
gaze beyond the gates and behold the splendid fortress in all its
marvel!

  The huge fortress blocks most of the view to the north with its
massive size.  The ground beneath your feet is covered in soft,
bright green grass, with little clusters of blue and violet flowers
evenly spread across the large courtyard.  Looking up at the sky
you see the branches of the huge trees surrounding this large, yet
isolated grove, grow into and support the massive wooden fortress
as if they are and always have been one.  The sunlight shines
through the leaves of oak, birch and ash, creating lively shadows
that move playfully across the ground.  The feeling of extreme
joy and comfort is overwhelming.

  The main hall is very quiet, and you can hear the playful singing of
the birds outside in what now seems a far distance.  The whole interior
of this hall has been carved from wood, with the only exception being
the floor which consists of many marble tiles arranged in a mosaic of
beautiful patterns.  The main pillars holding up the enormous roof are
made from solid oak, while the panels on the walls are skillfully carved
in birch, displaying patterns of vines and a myriad of mythical animals.
There is a dim light coming from the room to the west, and the sweet smell
of Halfling-leaf smoke emerges through the half open door to the east.

  It would appear that it has been aeons since this room has been cleaned
up!  All sorts of note-books and paper slips can be found all over the
floor here, and the candle-wax from the many candles illuminating this
room seems to have almost grown into the interior and become one with it.
There is a large oval conference-table in the middle of this room, taking
up most of the space, almost comletely covered in old frilled notes, battle-
plans and strategies.  On the wallsaround you there are several old
paintings depicting the High-Elves's many adventures and accomplishments.
Amongst those of them that you can recognize you see the defeat of the Huge
Queen Ant, and the demise of the Shadow Demon, both of which you have heard
many terrifying stories about.

There are beautifully woven rugs on the floor, depicting ancient battles

There are many chairs, sofas and finely crafted tables arranged around

south wall makes the many carved figures and sculptures around the room
come to life.  At the eastern side of the room you see shelves filled
with the finest elven cognac and halfling ale.  The smell and sight of
them invite an urge to sit down in one of the many heavy chairs and
just mellow out with a glass of cognac and a pipe of halfling leaf.

are many rooms on either sides of the hallway leading to various rooms
of curiosity.  Paintings fill the walls on both sides of the hallway,
each painting depicting a certain event in the history of the High Elves
clan.  There is a strange smell reeking from the room to the west, while
a huge open iron-wood door studded in vines of thick wrought iron leads

the room you realise it is much larger than it first appeared.  As
you feel around the room, you pass over a pile of pillows to your left
and a shelf with small bottles next to it.  You find a small table
toward the far end of the room with a couple chairs sitting along the
wall.  Feeling along the wall, you finally come upon a torch that you 
quickly light to become more familliar with your surroundings.  Letting
your eyes become used to the low light of the torch, you see that this
small room had been used by "special" patrons of the tavern for what
looks like every possible vise.  Gambling, sex, drugs and whatever
you could think of probably occured in this room, most likely within the
past couple of days!  Back past the keg lies the main Tavern.

   Upon entering this grand old tavern, the chants of drinking songs 
that tell the tales of legendary heroes rattle through your head. 
The chants are in tune to mugs of ale swinging in the air as the 
hero slays the mighty beast.  As you look around the tavern, you see 
bards, mages and warriors singing alike.  It seems as if everyone is 
welcome at this festive meeting place.  A roaring fireplace flickers 
light and shadows upon the walls almost as if it were dancing with 
the song.  The tavern owner can be seen keeping mugs and tankards 
full, sending each pint of ale to its doom in the belly of traveler 
after traveler.  Above the tavern is built an extravagant inn.  
Travelers often rest here after too much of a good night in the 
tavern below.  Long term boarding is also available if you ever 
planned to explore this grand town or the areas around it.  The 
Innkeeper welcomes each new guest as they enter the tavern to offer 
room and board to the weary adventurer.  Back to the south is the 
town square.

mystical town where anything can happen.  A tingle of wonderment 
sends chills down your spine as you stroll down this busy street. 
In the center, you stand before a grand polished-black marble 
statue that rests in the center of a spectacular fountain.  The 
marble statue is of the famed Saber-Tooth Tiger which was created 
by a traveling mage to protect this magical town.  At the left of 
the statue sits a small onyx pedestal that holds a rather large 
log book.  To the north is the Witch and Whistle Tavern, to the 
east is the town's bank, to the west is the general store.
