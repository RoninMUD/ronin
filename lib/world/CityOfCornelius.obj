potion~
 Recent spikes in the cost of ferrous ores have driven up the cost of
ingredients to alchemists across the world, especially the rusty-hued
potable familiar to most adventurers: the orange potion. Coupled with
this rise in ingredient cost, the City of Cornelius, facing possible
bankruptcy, has been forced to increase rent costs for shop space.
 Facing a lose-lose scenario where he must either relocate and lose his
client base, or file for bankruptcy himself the wizard had to reinvent
his business plan.
 Enter the new jewel of his alchemy trade: the orange-brown potion. At
first glance yes, it's verging on price gouging, however if one takes
time to recognize all the economic and supply-chain factors at work, it
makes perfect sense.
 The wizard is not all about profits, he was also kind enough to add a
bit of healing to this potion as well, making it more versatile while
still offering the vitality and endurance boosts that made its ancestor
so popular.
