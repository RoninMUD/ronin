carving stone sane~
The huge statue completely dominates the atmosphere in this enormous hall.
The statue is split straight down the middle, with the right half depicting
a tall man wearing a suit and a leather shoe.  In his right hand he holds a
keyboard, and caries a burdened and dark apathic facial expression, his sad
eyes staring straight down onto the floor.  The left half depicts a god
amongst men, ruler of the heavens, creator of unimaginable things beyond
mortal comprehension.  His body wrapped in a shredded straightjacket, his
left leg resting firmly at the roots of the mother tree Yggdrasil that holds
Midgaard. His fiery look stares down onto Midgaard in rejoice.  In his left
hand he holds a glowing gem, which is said to contain what the elders simply
refer to as "the code".
There is a mithril inscription at the base of the statue.
The inscription reads:
Sane giveth, and Sane taketh away.
