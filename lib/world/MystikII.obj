  Erik Shadesbane gathered about him fifty hearty souls, and their 
families, and claimed the area now known as Sarth for himself. They
were settled in and fortified by the end of the year. The following 
year the budding town was attacked by barbarians who sailed Long-ships
into the harbor. This was a dark time, for though the raiders were 
fought off, half the town was destroyed and many lives were lost.
Seeing the need for better defenses and more defenders, Erik split 
his remaining forces into two groups. He sent his ten most trusted men
on a mission to other cities and towns to recruit more families. He
took the remaining followers, after burning the town that they worked
so hard to build, up to the top of the single nearby mountain. At the
summit they built a heavily fortified Keep to defend themselves until
the reinforcements arrived.

  I am Father Pratix, Abbot of Shadesbane Abbey. Today is the one 
hundredth anniversary of the Liberation of Sarth. The city's Archmage,
with the help of an Oriental Elementalist made a suit of armor for 
the event. They are going to have it blessed by Ishap and donated it 
to the church in thanks for us saving them from misery. This is 
definitely a good day to rejoice in a century of peace and prosperity.
This will be the last entry in this journal, as age is taking its 
toll on the pages.

  Today we discuss how this city should be ruled. Some of our clerics
favor a Theocracy. I, however, believe that the politics intrinsic 
with government would corrupt and eventually destroy our order. My 
plan is to keep the government along the lines of what the renown 
Erik Shadesbane intended, with added safeguards to keep this type of 
atrocity from happening again. My proposed m as r  a e ...

  I am Malach. It has been twenty years since the Second Mayor of
Sarth had the High Priest Adrach beheaded and our faith denounced as
heresy. Our temple in Sarth was looted and burned. That evil leader 
even dared to send an army of mercenaries to attack our Abbey. It was
a close fight, but our stronghold was made for defense and our 
Templars were up to the challenge. This isn't the only city in which 
these revolting deeds were perpetrated. Of the fifty-three temples 
our faith had in various cities and towns, only this one and our main
Temple survive.

... It has been a fulfilling sixty years as High Priest of Sarth. 
Tomorrow, however, I must engage in a sorrow-filled task. Erik, the 
Mayor and my good friend, has passed away. I can only hope that the 
next Mayor is as helpful to the priesthood. Erik has been a true ally
to us.
  The funeral was today. The body has been interred. Though it 
grieves me dearly to lose a trusted friend, I know that there are few
people in history who have accomplished more than Erik in their 
lives. Erik's will was read over the gravesite. He left the church 
one final gift. It seems that he had an anvil enchanted by a passing 
wizard and has bequeathed it to our faith. I have already made plans 
for it to be moved to the mountaintop Abbey. I would prefer to keep
it here, but I am an old man who may go to meet Ishap any day and I
have no idea how the new Mayor will act towards the Faith.

  The ordained religion in the city below us believes in an evil god
whose name is too vile for me to desecrate this parchment with. 
Luckily, we have two advantages on our side. One, because the 
government below is so harsh, we have no shortage of volunteers to
train as priests and templars. Second, we have an ally staying with
us. Mordikai, the City's Magician, fled the city after destroying his 
tower so that its secrets wouldn't be found by those heretics.
  Mordikai is going to help us carry out a task that has been forced
upon us. In order to save our faith and the knowledge that we guard,
we have no choice but to attack Sarth and free it from the clutches
of the vile God whose minions now rule.
  We did it!!! Mordikai transported our forces directly into Town 
Square. I had to do something that shall surely weigh heavily on my 
soul for the rest of my days. I ran up to the guard barracks and 
asked Ishap to smite that structure with an earthquake. There were no
survivors.

  Two years later the recruiters returned, bringing with them more 
than a hundred warriors and their families. Also in the group was a 
budding mage, named Mordikai, and myself, a humble Acolyte of Ishap.
  Erik left a small garrison at the Keep, then took the rest of his
followers down to the harbor to rebuild their city. I went with the 
builders and raised a small outdoor altar to my Deity. Erik was so
pleased to have a cleric to heal the injuries of the workers. He made
a promise to me that, when the City was completed, he would donate
the Keep to Ishap so that the priesthood would have a Safe Haven to
study and train new priests.

  Today was very heartwarming to my old soul. One of the orphans that
that we raised in the Abbey helped to kill a dragon about a year ago. 
He really has become a great adventurer. Why I remember... Forgive me,
I am rambling like an old man, which I am. The boy-turned-adventurer
went to my friend Mordikai and with his help they made a pair of 
boots from the dragon's hide. The process is unknown to me.. I never 
really had a grasp on magic no matter how much Mordikai... I'm 
rambling again. Anyway, the young man, on the day I declared my 
retirement, donated the boots to Ishap in my name. It brightened my 
soul to know that this brave young man considered me as his role-
model while growing up. When Ishap calls me I know I'll go willingly,
for I am sure that I have made a difference in at least one life.

  There was a ferocious battle waged in the town today... I'll write 
about it in detail as soon as the reports come in.
  I was right, it was a terrible battle. Half the City was demolished
and many residents and soldiers were killed. It was actually two 
separate battles, one on each side of the City, and it was against a 
most unusual enemy. A pair Blue Dragons attacked and wreaked havoc 
until one was killed and the other was driven off. Here are the 
details as they were told to me.

  It has been a month since the attack. We've tried everything in our
power to restore Greybeard's sight, to no avail. Unable to do his job,
in spite of his battle prowess, The old soldier has reluctantly 
resigned, naming Jorge, nicknamed One-Eye, as his Successor. It is
a sad day for the City. Greybeard has proven himself the best Captain
the place has ever had. May Greybeard live in peace for the rest of 
his years.

strike before the lizard could line up its mouth for another breath.
The Dragon finally realized it was no match for the cunning soldier
it was facing and tried to back off and flee. Greybeard, realizing
his opportunity, tumbled in and slammed his sword into the Dragon's
wounded chest, piercing the heart and sending the Dragon into death 
throes. By the time the other fighters arrived the Dragon was already
a still corpse. 
  The guards were in awe of their Captain's fighting prowess, even 
more so when they realized that the Dragon's breath had seared their 
leader's eyes shut before he had even managed to strike one blow. He 
had fought a Dragon while injured and blinded, yet had managed to 
kill it when the City's entire guard force had only managed to fight 
off the other dragon which had attacked.

    BATTLE 2:
  Greybeard rushed upon the Dragon while it was busy destroying a
tavern. Greybeard's attempt to get inside the Dragon's deadly breath
was unsuccessful, however. The Dragon was a little more alert than 
the wily fighter gave it credit for. The Dragon swiftly turned and 
sent a searing bolt of electricity at its lone assailant. Greybeard
saw the Dragon's swift turn and dodged deftly to the side, missing
most of the effects of the breath. As the fighter screamed in pain,
he reached the dragon and delivered a series of blinding fast 
attacks, slashing his sword between scales and through dragon skin
with an accuracy unrivaled by any other fighter in Sarth. The damage 
caused by the Dragons breath attack would not be known by any other 
than Greybeard until the fight was over. Every time the dragon tried
to catch the Captain of the Guard with a claw or bite, the 
experienced warrior would dodge nimbly away, only to come back in and

    BATTLE 1:
  A Blue Dragon attacked the east side of town, destroying the City's
East Plaza. The guards responded, led by the Captain of the Guard,
Greybeard. As the soldiers engaged the Dragon, another attacked the 
undefended west side of town. The Captain of the Guard left the east 
battle to attempt to keep the other dragon busy while this one was 
handled. He left a daring young guardsman known as Jorge in charge
of the City Guards in his absence. Jorge led an all out attack on the
Dragon going so far as to actually go into melee with the fearsome
creature. During the fight Jorge lost his left eye to a devastating
swipe of a dragon's claw. The Dragon slowly gave way under the 
assault and was forced to flee the City, leaving its mate to fend for
himself.

  Today was a bleak day in the annals of this Abbey. An evil general 
led an army against our Keep. The army appeared out of nowhere and  
assaulted our holy stronghold before we could get our defenses 
organized. The General and his mount, a vicious red dragon, attacked 
and killed our Defender. His Army then climbed the walls, forcing us 
to retreat to the Keep proper. Instead of attacking and destroying us
the General merely took all the Magic Items our Defender was wearing 
and the Magical anvil that was in the courtyard.. The General and the
army then disappeared in a flash of light. Our defender's body has 
been consecrated to the earth already.
  I have talked to the other priests about hiring mercenaries to 
track down this rogue and recover our items... After all, we can't 
make any more Holy Relics without a replacement for the magical Anvil
that the fouls beings stole.

  Marcus was taken to jail by the Captain of the Sarthian Guard. The
Mayor set the trial for later in the morning. Marcus was found guilty
and sentenced to death by stoning. Mordikai then did what most people
least expected. He asked the judge to reconsider the sentence and,
instead of Execution, banish the cold hearted murderer from the City
forever. The Judge, swayed by the eloquent words of the Archmage,
remanded the sentence and took Mordikai's advice... About an hour ago
Marcus was escorted from the City in chains and was warned that if he
returned his life would be forfeit. 
  As the apprentice was escorted from the City, Mordikai made a 
public apology for the damage, promised to pay for all expenses the 
fight had caused, and vowed to never take another apprentice as long 
as he lived in Sarth.
~
E
page2~
  I have never seen Mordikai use his magical ability before today. 
Indeed I am still unsure if what I witnessed was the limits of his 
vaunted powers. Even if it wasn't, it was an awe-inspiring spectacle
which will forever remind the people of this town just how deadly the
Archmage really is.
  The event I am talking about is the attempted assassination of 
Mordikai by his apprentice Marcus. The Archmage and I were in the
Town Square debating on whether to have an early dinner when Marcus 
struck.  The attack came without warning and, though I wasn't the 
target, it knocked me through  the window into the Pastry Shop to the 
north. Unfortunately for the murderous Marcus, Mordikai's clothes
weren't even singed. Mordikai's counter attack not only nearly killed
the apprentice but also Destroyed the Armorer's Shop that was 
directly behind him.
~
E
page1~
  Mordikai announced today that he was taking an apprentice. He 
explained it by saying that the City was growing to such a size that
the demands for magical assistance were more than one mage could 
handle. He called himself an tired, old mage who would like to relax
in his later years. I never thought of Mordikai as old, but he has to
be at least one-hundred-eighty years of age. It would be hard to 
imagine a Sarth without Mordikai as the City's Archmage. If anything 
should happen to him, I hope that this new apprentice, Marcus, can 
fill his shoes adequately.
