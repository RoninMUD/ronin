belt angel feathers shimmering iridescent~
The belt is crafted from fine, iridescent blue-green feathers that have been
woven together in an intricate, interlaced pattern.  The feathers are long,
slender and very delicate-looking, but they are actually as strong as steel and
nearly impervious to mortal attacks.  The clasp that binds the belt is made from
pure platinum and has been crafted into the figure of an angel with its wings
folded about a featureless being.  It is said that these belts are the greatest
gift an archangel may give to a mortal, being made from the angel's own
feathers.  They are only given in times of great need or great celebration to
one the angel deems worthy enough to wear it.  The owner of the belt must be
powerful indeed and held in the highest of graces to posses such an item.

kilt~

  This legendary kilt was last worn by Lord Durinn of the McRibald clan in his last
stand against his rival Scottish Clan.  When the battle was over, covered in his
enemies' blood, Durinn was betrayed by his second-in-command, stabbed in the back.
His bodily remains were scattered across the land.  His kilt, according to folklore,
absorbed his dying scream,

                "`iREVENGE SHALL BE MINE`q!"

and imbues the wearer with evil tendencies to smite those who have done them wrong
in the past.

This large metal bandoleer seems to be designed as an ornamental piece of
equipment, a mark of some type of rank or status that its wearer holds.  It is
crafted from pitch-black anodized aluminum, an extremely rare metal in this
age, created by a well-guarded process.  A single platinum emblem of a vertical
metal bar in the center of a diamond-shaped field has been mounted at
breast level. The entire piece weighs much less than it appears to; as such, it
is comfortable to wear for extended periods.  The hardness and durability of
the metal is remarkable, and offers a good amount of protection for the regions
it covers.  The bandoleer hums with magical energy, another testament to its
importance.

medicinal purposes for generations.  Its well-known pleasurable affects
have also been used by clansmen and warriors to relax after long weary
battles upon their return to the village.

cape smouldering hemp~
Handwoven by the hemp farmers of the dale, this cape has a sweet yet skunky
odor that simultaneously repulses and beguiles. While still damp from the
early spring rains the hemp is harvested and woven into extremely tight,
dense ropey thread. When the criss-cross fabric is completed in enormous
ten cubit by ten cubit pieces, it is stretched over hot coals for the rest
of the spring season, whose constant wet rains and mild temperatures keep
the fabric from catching a blaze. Months later, when the rains have stopped
the fabric is made into various garments while it smoulders still from the
coals it rested upon. Many have speculated as to why the fabric smoulders
everlong, but the truth is something only the farmers themselves know.
