banner cloth asmoday~
  The banner is old and frayed. Its edges
are gilded with a gold fabric, and the
golden symbol of the 72 Legions of Hell
is embroyded onto it; lined with silver
thread. The cloth smells of sulfur and 
stale blood.
`a`q
  The powers resting within this banner
would completely overtake any weak soul.
It would appear only Asmodaeus the
Daemon-Lord himself would be strong enough
to wield the banner's true potential.
`a`q
  A strong willed Crusader of the Lord 
could possibly subdue the powers within,
but would most likely only be able to
wield a fraction of it.
`a`q
  Fain screams, almost whispers of ancient
battles can be heard as the wind buffets
the pitch black cloth.
