Da Doobies' House of Hemp~
This is the safe haven for the members of the Da Doobies clan, where the
members come to relax and enjoy themselves.  You are astounded by the
appearance of the room.  Everything seems to be made of hemp...it's as if
the whole room was one gigantic bud!  Plants grow all over the walls and
furniture of this smoke filled heaven.  Sliteyed, You wander aimlessly
around the room carefully examining everything you come upon. A collection
of pipes and bongs of all different shapes and sizes lie on the table next
to a bowl full of munchies. The walls are decorated with a psychadelic
painting continuing endlessly throughout the whole room. A comfy looking
sofa with feathery pillows has been placed in the centre of the room around
a large wooden table.  In one of the corners of the room is a small cooling
cabinet filled with refreshments and munchies to soothen that dry mouth after
a good session.  Inhailing the smoke you feel completely at ease in this room
of tranquility and wonder, why anyone would ever want to leave.

Inside the Iron Tower of Diabolik~
   You stand inside a vast cylindrical structure made entirely of one 
piece of solid iron. Torchlight eerily plays about the walls and many 
tapestries that adorn the walls creating flittering shadows that jump 
about the walls almost as if they were alive.  A dark sense of forboding 
grips your chest as footfalls echo throughout the chamber, reverberating
endlessly off the thick walls.

A Crystal-Domed Armory~
   You are inside a massively constructed vault and armory complex, weapons
and armors the like of which you've never seen line the walls in special 
racks, many of them glowing with mystical dweomers.  The crystal dome 
overhead also appears to me quite magical in nature, its facets breaking 
up the sunlight into tiny rainbows as you look at it. As the massive vault 
door thuds shut behind you, you feel somewhat safe even though there's a 
brute of a guard who'll kill you in a heartbeat if you dont belong here.

The Rusty Sword~
  As you top the stairs, your eyes behold a wondrous sight. Before you is a
large hall filled with long tables that are surrounded by comfortable chairs.
The Hall's walls are covered with the banners of each individual clan that 
makes up the entirety of Diabolik. The floor is made of solid, well-worn oak
that has been stained by ale being repeatedly spilled on its surface by
joyful members of the elite club. The pillars holding up the roof are shaped
like giant swords. They are made of solid iron and, as a result, are slightly 
rusting from years of exposure. It is obvious where the name for this famous 
tavern came from.  On top of each table are places set with the names of 
Diabolik Members in front of each. Around the fireplaces, there are more chairs
drawn together so that these professional killers can share tales of the
adventures with one another. On one side of the hall is a bar, behind which 
are several shelves lined with every alcoholic beverage you could imagine... 
and some beyond your imagination. Thick oaken stairs wind around the
circumference of the room, leading down and also up to yet another level.

Tacked high up on the rafters, many different banners are raised here to
honor the clans from which a great many of our members hailed from.
Amongst the many banners you see A totally black flag which must belong to
DARK, another right beside it bearing a shield crossed with a sword, spear
and mace with the word HELLIONS emblazoned beneath it, another with a
clenched fist which belongs to DAMAGE INC, and finally a simply designed
banner bearing a shield with the letters LV upon it. On the other side of 
the room, nearly out of view, is tacked an unusual looking yellow and red 
banner with a 5 leafed plant as its emblem.

Diabolik Room of Ancient Knowledge~
   You stand inside a vast libram of ancient texts, many of which scrawled
in tongues which you havent the slightest grasp of understanding. The shelves 
reach far far above you, nearly three times your height they stretch until
they finally abut a metal ceiling. On a great many of the shelves tomes, 
scrolls and other works radiate soft auras, giving away at least a tiny hint 
of their arcane nature.

   Before you stands a flaming entrance, and with each step closer, does

threatened.  The flames will harm no one that belongs, yet will do
sustainable damage to those who do not. A hooded receptionist stands
before the flaming opening, head hidden underneath his guise, and slightly
tilted as if he was staring at the floor.  He motions his hands in your
direction as if he were trying to get your to come closer.

members can practice and hone their skills.  Weapons of all sorts hang on
the walls, all from slashing to piercing types.  Also hung on the walls
are heads of the various mobs killed in battle, ranging from the Queen
Ant, the Warden, and Dagoor.  Looking far across the room is a marble
mantle, with pictures of Diabolik members and a huge crest of the Diabolik
Clan.  A training dummy stands meekly in the center of the training hall,
cringing away from your approach.

The Gateway to Hell~
   A powerful force pulls you towards the whirling vortex in the center of
this incredibly hot cavern.  A large pentagram has been crudely etched into
the floor, still wet with fresh blood.  The smells of sulfur, fire, and
brimstone are strong here, suggesting that the vortex is a one way ticket 
to the dominions of the devils, succubi, and incubi who are lazily lounging
about, beckoning with leering grins and half bare bodies shiny with sweat.

   Thin wisps of smoke curl up from the floorboards, casting everything
into a heated haze of incense, blood, and heavy perfume.  All along the
walls, glowing red coals hiss and crackle, as if possessed with a life of
their own.  The floor curves slightly downwards, towards the bubbling lava
spring in the center of the antechamber, where buxom succubi and naughty
incubi are sporting away, in full view.  The tantalizing smell of sizzling
bacon and the scattered bits of clothing strewn all about the chamber 
suggest that this is the place to be.

The Cavern of Tantalus~
   Wavering shadows are created by the flickering torches that line the
walls of this dank and gloomy cavern.  The sound of slowly dripping water
is maddening, more so in the otherwise inpenetrable silence.  A small,
dirty pool of water has formed in the center of the cavern, in which
stands the man fated to suffer forever hunger and thirst for presenting
before the immortals a feast made from his butchered son's meat.  Rumors
have it that Sumo enjoyed the feast even more so after thus learning of
Tantalus' treachery, but the congression of immortals had to teach the
rest of the mortals some respect for the gods and thus, punished Tantalus
accordingly.  All legends speak of Tantalus and his inability to neither
drink a single drop of water nor eat the smallest morsel.  As can be seen
though, he lives the life of relative luxury, only wetting his feet now
and then for appearances' sake.

   A faint breeze blows softly into the room, gently stirring the black
silk veils on the quaint victorian bed.  A tarnished bowl of sandalwood
burns into the wee hours of the night, casting lazy curls of perfumed
smoke into the air. In one corner of the chamber lies a wash basin, filled
with rose petals from sweeter days.  The air is still, except for the
strains of a classical harpsicord whose source is yet undetermined.
Over the bed, a magically suspended black pearl softly illuminates the
chamber, and you see a beautifully carved crest which proudly bears the
likeness of the Grand Lady Vampiress, Lakhena.

The Grand Obsidian Dome~
A dragon shaped fountain erupts from the rock floor below your feet,
spewing swirling tie-dyed colors from its mouth into a crescent-shaped
bath below its giant marble claws.  Behind the magnificent statue a
tapestry depicting a wolf howling at a full moon hangs by two sturdy
daggers still dripping blood on the shiny floor.  The floor is pitch
black and gleams like obsidian under the morning sun.  As you look to
the ceiling you notice a spectacular domed ceiling rising up more than
fifty feet.  More ornate statues adorn the room all with gleaming gems
for eyes.  Huge ovoid archways lead to the east and west from here. A
feeling of awe overwhelms you as you gawk at the majesty and sheer
beauty of the room.  The gaping ceiling opens in a giant crescent at
the top allowing sun and moonlight to shine through, reflecting off
the jewelled eyes of the statues.  In particular the fountain dragon's
eyes seem to follow your every movement.  With each quiet step, a calm
breeze rushes past your face leaving small ripples in the fountain's
firey red pool.

Taking a closer look at the beautiful obsidian floor you observe
the translucence of the material.  You can see partly through the
floor but not entirely, like looking into a bubble but not seeing
the other side.  As you examine the expansive dome you realize the
incredible amount of obsidian used throughout.  The owners of this
hall must have mined the Obsidian Hills thoroughly.

statues~
The numerous statues of serpents, dragons, and wolves line the
circular wall of the dome.  Eyes sparkling green, blue, and red
from the emeralds, sapphires, and rubies inlaid on their eyes.
The artist responsible for these magnificent masterpieces 
deserves many kudos.  Each statue rests upon a pedastal about
three feet off the ground, made of smooth swirling marble.
All of them seem angled so they stare directly at the fountain
in the middle of the room with the giant perching dragon acting
almost as if it was all of these creatures' mother.

Famous "Crescent Moon" Club~
The scenery has changed dramatically from the previous room and
you blink a few times to make sure you aren't imagining things.
Stretching out beneath your feet, numerous antique chinese rugs
rest on the smooth ivory floor.  Again, the ceiling is a high rise
dome, but this one does not reach nearly as high.  The ceiling is
a beautifully polished glass, clear as water.  Wonderfully carved
four-post master beds line the walls inviting you to rest for a
while. The fabrics covering them are rare silks of glorious reds,
blues, greens, oranges, yellows, and any color imaginable.  Warm,
bubbling mud baths fill the room with a constant "pop, pop" and
exotic plants release delightful smells and scents into the clean
air. A giant marble master bathtub with obsidian handles and feet
sits comfortably on the floor atop the hide of some wild animal.
Reserved for the heads of this establishment its warm and bubbly
waters await the return of its owners.

Extremely lavish oriental rugs stretching atleast twenty feet

Luna's Boudoir~
Nestled comfortably on her large bed, Luna scans the room for new
visitors. This is her private playpen.  Decorated in greens and blues
more spectacular than you could ever imagine, it leaves you with a
calm feeling.  Floating in a body of water this room is a perfect
replica, and has the feeling, of a fishbowl.  Tropical fish and
assortments of ocean life float past as you stare into the endless
sea. Sunlight pours through the watery depths and sends tiny rays
of color bouncing around the glass room.  Across the room a large
closet reveals a gigantic vault.  Apparently the temptress that
lives here owns this as well as everything else in this room.  You
only hope that the use of the vault comes free of charge, though
money does not seem to be the lady's first desire.  Assorted pieces
of female clothing adorn the floor and furniture.  Perhaps it's not
the best idea to stay here for long, the lady on the bed seems to be
eyeing you with great interest.

Night Chambers' of Blood Moon~
These are the nightly resting rooms for the great owners of this humble
abode. Their trustworthy and nocturnal friend, Mond the wolf guardian,
keeps a weary eye out for trespassers.  Each of the followers of Blood
Moon receives their own chambers to spend many days and nights relaxing
in their own private style.  Dark and quiet, Mond rests comfortably in
the silence of the eternal night.  Through the blackness you can make
out his shimmering green eyes with their dark vertical slits.  Also
illuminating the room are more of the glowing ruby-eyed dragon statues
you have noticed throughout the grand hall.  The floor beneath your
tired feet is layered in animal hides, probably the trophies of Mond's
endless hunting.  Stumbling awkwardly through the darkness you feel
around for something to hold on to but the walls are slightly moist
and slippery.  The endless night that Mond's living conditions demand
are clearly not fit for the likes of you.  Despite the virtual blind
stupor the room leaves you in, a very calming feeling rushes at you
from every direction soothing your muscles and easing your tension.

Wow, this bathtub is amazingly roomy.  You have entered the wonderful
realm of bath oils, suds, bubbles, and a rubber ducky?  Peering over
the bubbles in the massive tub you can see the welcoming beds of the
Famous "Crescent Moon" Club and your towel strewn across the glass
floor. As you lean your head back against the cushioned rims of the
marble tub you close your eyes and relax in complete bliss.  The water
is the perfect temperature and you feel your troubles washing away.
Beautiful odors and scents rise out of the bubbles as they pop in the
air. Your wounds begin to heal as the pure waters cleanse your skin.
This truly is paradise.  Feeling the waters temperatures subsiding
slightly you reach for the hot water nozzle and notice a miniature
marble dragon with the same glimmering ruby-eyes as the fountain's.

   You enter into the Grand Foyer of the Castle of the Dark Legion.
You stare in awe at the intensity of the room.  The walls are 
made of pure black ebon.  Curtains leading to your private chambers
line the east and west ends of the room.  Ornate tapestrys of past 
adventures adorn the walls, hanging in solemn beauty.  They tell the
tales of the heroic Legioneers who dared risk their lives destroying
the feared monsters of Ronin.  You gaze up at a crystal chandalier 
hanging from the oaken ceiling.  It covers the room in an eerie dark
light. The room is also glowing with strange candles that burn with 
blue flame.  Chills run down your spine as you hear your footsteps 
echoing off the castle walls.  Though this is your home, you still 
get a strange feeling of fear burning within your soul.

   You enter into the Grand Conservatory of this tremendous castle.
Ancient paintings and tapestrys hang from the walls and a beautiful
mural of ancient gods adorn the ceiling.  As you look from painting
to painting you get a glimpse into the past and it is as if you had
just revisited each time in a flashback.  Huge torches burn a bright 
blue flame in each of the corners, they cast an eerie glow on the
strange statues of demons and people that are cast into alcoves along 
the walls.  You recognize some of the faces on the statues to be that 
of your own.  A fireplace burns brightly on the north end of the room, 
though the fire rages you feel no heat eminating from it.  However, the
room is not cold at all.  With each footstep you take it feels as if for
a moment you are in a different world, revisiting the past places that
are depicted on the paintings.  The magic at work here is obviously very
powerful. The entry hall is to the south, to the east you hear a strange
bubbling noise, and to the west is the clanging of weapons and metals.

   You enter into a rather small nook of the castle.  Shelves cover
three of the walls here.  On each shelf there is hundreds of magic
beakers and various tubes and magic utensils.  Odd bags of unknown
substances line the floor and the room is quite a mess.  A strange
mist hangs heavy about the room.  The mist does not however block
your view of the room, it just creates an eerie atmosphere.  There
is a large stone counter in the centre of the room, and behind it
stirring a strange mixture in her cauldron is the old witch Greedle.
She glares up at you with her milky white eyes and smiles.  This 
would be a good place to pick up some supplies that Greedle may have
sitting around.

   You enter into a large storage room of sorts.  There are huge shields
and weapons hanging from the walls, that the previous warriors of the
Legion have used in battle.  This is a room of war, and there
are some ancient artifacts adorning the room.  These artifacts are
old motheds of protection and destroying the Legion has used in the past
to defeat and destroy their enemies.  Some of these chaos and torture
devices scare you as you look at them.  Just picturing yourself in one
of them causes you to cringe in fear.  You can only imagine the horror
some of your enemies faced as the Legion captured and destroyed them.  
Huge metals vaults adorn the walls here, this is where the Dark Legion
stores its extra items of value.  Raven, the guardian of this room is 
here mending and testing the weapons that need to be fixed, she glances
up at you and welcomes you to enter.  This would be a good place to 
lighten your load and hand some of your things over to Raven.

The Glass Tower~
   You climb a winding staircase into a tower constructed of glass.
The view here is breathtakingly beautiful.  You can see all over
the forest and the snow capped Helventia mountains.  The glorious
rivers and valleys of the woods long beneath you.  Far off in the
distance you can even make out the temple in town.  As you gaze
out over the country you can see the various wildlife taking care
of business, the rabbits hopping around, chewing on leaves, you
see foxes playing in a meadow, and a wonderous Elk jumping through
its domain.  From here you truly appreciate the beauty of nature.
The Legion has used this room in mental and physical training.  
The Legion always had respect for nature and its powers, and 
sometimes nature has been used by the Legion to channel their
powers. In this room you feel at peace, and in touch with yourself
and your environment.

The Dark Altar of Power~
   You follow the staircase into this dark and powerful room.  This is
the Altar of Sacrifice, where the Legion gives offerings and prayers
to the gods.  The room is lit by more blue flames and there are 
various torches and candleabras adorning the room.  On the north wall
there is the actualy altar of the gods.  It is tremendous in size
and is adorned with candles, and treasures.  Carved into the dark
structure are the faces of angels and demons, thier faces twisted into
positions of agony.  This symbolizes the power of the gods.  As you 
gaze up you find that this room has no ceiling, but it is a twisting
portal of blue, violet, and pink clouds in a swirling mass.  You see
the outline of spirits flying amidst the mass, they are chanting and
moaning softly.  You can feel the power in this room, and it seems to
be adding to your own.  You feel yourself being restored and your magic
powers are coming back to you, your body surges with the power of your
gods. A black liquid flows from the altar.  This is the blood of the
Legion.

the presence of many great heroes and legends from times past enrich
you. There are statues and plaques lining the walls of the hallway to
the main room.  Each has a small inscription in it, telling about who it
goes out in honor to.  In the distance you can see a very dim light coming
from underneath one of the doors, on the door reads 'Board Room'. As you
peer around, you also see something that looks like main room of 
the complex.

of many of the famous people who have stayed here, including
Hugh Hefner.  Hugh is quoted as saying, "Hotel Newbie is my home

  You heave a sigh of relief at the familiar surroundings of the Newbie Lounge.
As you gaze around this immense room, you begin to wonder why you ever leave it
at all.  The private quarters are arranged neatly to the west, while the open
bar occupies the northern side.  The remaining southern section houses the

denoting great thickness.  This might be the most secure room you have ever
been in.  Of course having Grunthor protecting the outer rooms can't hurt.

  This is a narrow side-path that leads off the Northern Trail and
into the dense woods that surround it.  From the main trail this path
didn't look like much of anything, but from here you can see that it
does appear to lead on for a bit.  The path leads deeper into the forest
to the West, or back to the Northern Trail to the East.

  You have entered the Newbie Atrium. This room is unlike anything
you have ever seen before. Besides the sheer size, there is a glass
domed ceiling that allows sunlight to stream in and fill every corner.
The plant life that is on display has been brought in from every
corner of the known world. There are benches discreetly placed along
each of the many walkways that allow for private contemplation.

Newbie Essentials~
   You gaze around the small square shack with wonder and amazement.
How can Sharak cram such enormous quantities in such a small space?
As your eyes wander from wall to wall you realize that there is
nothing you could possibly want that isn't neatly tucked away on a
shelf or dangling from a wall.  The only problem is that ol'Sharak
here is a full-blooded dwarf and he just loves to hoard.
Consequently, he only offers what he's willing to give up at the
time and those items are usually overstocked or leftovers from
his other ventures.

Instruction Room~
  Wandering to the west you find yourself in a large room with ancient looking
swords hung on the northern wall.  To the west, covering the entire wall hangs
the massive clan emblem.  Seemingly appearing out on nowhere a man stands next
to you with a beautifully made sword hanging from his belt and an aura of power
around him.  He stares at you for a moment with a startling intensity as if
peering into the depths of your soul searching for your weaknesses.  He then
informs you that he is the Chief Instructor of this fine clan and asks if you
would like a lesson in real fighting.  You can head east, the way you came
or you can stay and learn a thing or two.

Hidden Back Room~
   As you enter this hidden room, it's hard to make out your
surroundings from the lack of a good light.  Moving slowly around
the room you realise it is much larger than it first appeared.  As
you feel around the room, you pass over a pile of pillows to your left
and a shelf with small bottles next to it.  You find a small table
toward the far end of the room with a couple chairs sitting along the
wall.  Feeling along the wall, you finally come upon a torch that you 
quickly light to become more familliar with your surroundings.  Letting
your eyes become used to the low light of the torch, you see that this
small room had been used by "special" patrons of the tavern for what
looks like every possible vise.  Gambling, sex, drugs and whatever
you could think of probably occured in this room, most likely within the
past couple of days!  Back past the keg lies the main Tavern.

The Witch and Whistle Tavern~
   Upon entering this grand old tavern, the chants of drinking songs 
that tell the tales of legendary heroes rattle through your head. 
The chants are in tune to mugs of ale swinging in the air as the 
hero slays the mighty beast.  As you look around the tavern, you see 
bards, mages and warriors singing alike.  It seems as if everyone is 
welcome at this festive meeting place.  A roaring fireplace flickers 
light and shadows upon the walls almost as if it were dancing with 
the song.  The tavern owner can be seen keeping mugs and tankards 
full, sending each pint of ale to its doom in the belly of traveler 
after traveler.  Above the tavern is built an extravagant inn.  
Travelers often rest here after too much of a good night in the 
tavern below.  Long term boarding is also available if you ever 
planned to explore this grand town or the areas around it.  The 
Innkeeper welcomes each new guest as they enter the tavern to offer 
room and board to the weary adventurer.  Back to the south is the 
town square.

Everglade Town Square~
   You are standing in the heart of the lost town of Everglade. 
Legends and myths have been told about this mysterious town. 
As a child, you recall falling asleep, hoping to dream of this 
mystical town where anything can happen.  A tingle of wonderment 
sends chills down your spine as you stroll down this busy street. 
In the center, you stand before a grand polished-black marble 
statue that rests in the center of a spectacular fountain.  The 
marble statue is of the famed Saber-Tooth Tiger which was created 
by a traveling mage to protect this magical town.  At the left of 
the statue sits a small onyx pedestal that holds a rather large 
log book.  To the north is the Witch and Whistle Tavern, to the 
east is the town's bank, to the west is the general store.

From the wet smell of the warg fur and the unmistakable smell of
the newt toes, a new batch of cure poison is being made.  Shelves
line each wall full of foods and potions, scrolls and books.
Anything you could possibly imagine, and some things you couldn't,
are sold here.

   As you enter this cozy building, you feel the warmth of a 
greenish-blue flame that burns from the torches on the walls.
A small desk blocks your view of a short, fat dwarf sleeping 
under what looks to be his day's paperwork.  You hope he's not
in charge of guarding your things.  Looking past the desk, you 
see an endless hallway lined with platinum doors on each side 
as far as your eyes can see.  You realize the great magical 
forces at work in this town as you thought you were entering a 
small cottage.  Such a grand power must be used to be guarding 
something important.  Back to the west, you see the town's square.
