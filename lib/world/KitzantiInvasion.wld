At a gruesome sight.~
   The forest is suddenly interrupted here.  The trees are broken and
some look as if they were snapped by some incredible force.  Looking
around, the source of this disturbance can be seen.  A gigantic corpse
of a super sized humanoid figure lies here.  It looks to be a hunter
of some sorts.  From the stench, it can logically be concluded that
the corpse has been here for some time.  There is nothing of value on
the remains, but taking a closer look at the face, it looks possible
to crawl into the mouth, in fact, tracks can be seen leading in, but
what would want to go in such a place?

Within the mouth.~
   The mouth of the gigantic corpse smells terrible.  Rotten flesh hangs
all around and the decayed remains of some teeth scatter the makeshift
cave.  A faint light radiates from the outside world, but it barely can
penetrate the corpses lips which hang loosely from the skeleton.  Looking
forward, what appears to be a pit looms in the back of the mouth and it
is probably the esophagus which leads even deeper into the corpses remains.
The odd thing is, that there is a rope hanging from a tooth which leads
down into the darkness below.

Descending down into the darkness.~
   The rope continues it's descent down into the darkness.  It is
getting difficult to hold on because of the moisture which looms
in this area.  The walls here seem to be a bit more solid than the
rotten flesh above and the tunnel down seems to get more cramped
directly below.  Every so often, a faint noise can be heard from
below followed by a short clicking sound.

   It is really getting cramped here.  The walls of this tunnel
press gently against your body.  Getting this close to them, it is
realized that they feel very solid, like some sort of crystal
substance.  They seem to widen out below and only a faint trace
of daylight can be seen from above this far down.  The rope hangs
further down and it is getting very difficult to hold on now, as
this area is almost misty with the moisture, but the looming stench
seems to be getting better.

Behind the rib cage.~
   A large cage like structure fills this room.  It does not block
movement in any direction, but nonetheless appears to be a cage.  Upon
close inspection, this cage appears to be made of bone.  To the east
and west, large white domes fill the passage while to the south a large
fleshy mass can be faintly made out of the darkness.  The rope ends
here, but there is a sloping area near the back of this area which leads
down into more darkness.

   The fleshy mass looms in the darkness ahead.  This room resembles
a large tube and the walls seem to twitch from time to time.  The tube
is smooth and cold to the touch but smells awful.  The floor and ceiling
are the same and the tube seems to take a slight slope downward.  To the

Other than the green fuzzy substance, nothing more can be made out of

with a slimy substance.  Moisture fills the air and it is getting difficult
to breath due to the massive stink which hangs in the immediate area.
The walls and floor are soft to the touch and appear to be made of some
type of dead organic material.  The tunnel continues down and a faint

At the top of the stomach.~
   The tunnel suddenly opens up to a gigantic room.  The lining of
this room is very wrinkled and reeks of sulfur.  Far below your
current position a pool of liquid can faintly be seen.  Looking down,
there are many ledges leading off into various directions and each
appears to be made of a torn section of the fleshy walls of this room.
The tunnel leads back up, and it is probably safe to continue your

directions which have created ledge-like openings.  This room continues
back up as well as further down, and the pool of liquid can faintly
be seen.

A crystallized tunnel.~
   The tunnel abruptly ends here, but this is not a dead end.
There is a large sized hole in the floor here and it looks big
enough for a person to fit through.  Only darkness can be seen
below and the smooth and polished walls of this room seem to
be made around this hole.  This is probably the point where the
small intestine changed into the large intestine.

   The hole has led to a very steep tunnel descending further down.
This entire area is smooth and polished, so it might be wise to take
extra precautions to not slide down into the darkness below.  Looking
back up, nothing can be seen besides darkness and below, a faint
intersection is present.  The clicking noises now seem like they are
coming from all around.

A crystallized intersection.~
   The tunnel has now opened up to a series of crystallized halls.
The halls are made of the crystal material, but look like they
have been carefully crafted to become hallways.  The ceiling is
about twenty feet tall and the walls are about twenty feet apart.
This square like construction indicates that something intelligent
carved out these halls.

A crystallized hall.~
   The western tunnel is slightly wider than the intersection.  A
line is carved down the middle of this hallway in a straight pattern.
There are also scratches along this line every four inches or so and
yet it seems that they are not actually there when your foot touches
the place where the scratches should be.  Ahead, the hallway takes
a sharp turn north.

   The hallway takes a sudden turn north here.  In the corner of this
room, there is a small table-like structure.  To the north, the hallway
opens up to an elevated room where there appears to be a lot of odd-
looking furniture.  The hallway continues back east and the line in
the floor takes a ninety degree turn in the middle of the floor and
heads toward the room north.  The scratches still line the etching and
are present every four inches.

A crystallized outpost.~
   This room appears to be more of an outpost than a normal room.  The
floor curves upward and stairs lead to a platform in the middle of the
room.  On this platform, a rail extends on the outside edge and there
are several weapon and armor racks in the middle.  Some strange-looking
objects are scattered about the platform and look to be some equivalent
to chairs, but no human could sit on one of them comfortably.  The outpost
is pretty basic and since there is only one exit from this place, you
can't help but wonder why would an outpost be built here?

A crystallized hall.~
   The northern tunnel is of the same build as the intersection,
and is as featureless as it too.  To the north, it looks like the
hall ends and the intersection is back south.  The air here is
stagnant, almost like it has not been refreshed in quite some time.
Looking closer at the walls, it is noticed that they are made up
of the insides of the corpse as well.

   The northern hall has come to an end.  This dead end is pretty

floor here is a little different than the rest of the hall because
there is a carpet like object on the ground.  Other than the carpet,
nothing else is in this room.

boxes strewn about.  Although nothing looks that valuable, or
even useful, there are several items which you have never seen
before.  The walls here are not the usual flesh color, but instead
have been painted black.

   The eastern hall takes a slight descent.  The walls here are
slightly different than the previous areas because the crystal seems
almost like stone.  The fleshy color now is growing darker and
darker with each step east.  Looking east down the hallway, there is no
end in sight.  The slope continues downward and you suddenly realize
where about in the corpse you should be and it doesn't bring any
pleasant thoughts.

the walls here and the floor has suddenly switched from the polished
crystal to actual tiles which are dark grey in color and have a paper
feel to them.  Upon closer inspection, the walls are now actually
very similar to the floor and some of them are actually beginning to
peel loose.

blue sphere is hovering above the ground.

a great battle here in the past.

Approaching a shimmering portal.~
   The light from the blue sphere fills this room.  Although the
sphere is actually still in the next room, the intensity of its
light nearly blinds you.  The walls, floor, and ceiling are all
illuminated by this light and assume a bluish glow.  The remains
of a gate are scattered on the floor as if at one time someone
or something wanted to keep people away from the sphere, or perhaps
to keep people in.

not contain any claw or bite marks.  Upon closer inspection, the walls
appear to be made of bone.  There is a giant crack on the northern
section of the wall, probably from a massive blow to that area.  The
crack is too small to fit through, but is filled with the same slime
which covered the giant strand.

to these openings.  The strands are very clean and seem to be coated with
some sort of slime.  The walls in the room are as clean as those in the

hair on the ground and the passage continues up. Taking a closer look
