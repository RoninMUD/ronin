fountain~

 This fountain has been a monument of sorts within Orshingal
since its humble beginnings.  Although once located in the
central plaza north of here, it was moved later to be nearer
the residential districts to provide an easily accessible
water source.

 The surface of this ring has an eerie look to it. A seemingly
infinite pitch-black darkness swallows all light, yet reflects
your image. No hint of sun-flare touches the surface of the
ring, only faces are reflected by the haunting blackness. But
you notice that your features are oddly warped by the ring;
your eyes gleam with a deep blood red hue.
