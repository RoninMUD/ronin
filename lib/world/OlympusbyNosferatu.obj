armor~
This armor was crafted by the great Hephaestus himself. Working tirelessly
atop the peaks of Mount Olympus, he created an armor of such a high standard
as to be worn by the God of gods, Zeus. The armor gleams with a quiksilver
brightness rivaled by none. The center is forged with the symbol of the
Great God, a hand clutching a lightning bolt.

The seal will shatter, path revealed, to those of noble heart.
