signet tarion ring~

  It appears to be the seal of an ancient clan of knights,
disbanded long ago after the destruction of the great city
Tarion.  This signet resembles the strength and servitude
that all knights must have to become true heroes among men.

"Of all virtues, may kindness and loyalty always serve first."

ribbon~

  This fine silk ribbon bears the mark of the great cavalier
who owned it:  a strange squiggle in the shape of a P.

manuscript~

 The weathered pages tell of an alliance in the First Age
between the Tarion Cavaliers and the Dragon Tamer's from
Helventia. Once, these two great nations held the rampaging
Ettins at bay for seventeen long, bloody years of battle
before finally driving them back into the swampy caves in
the west.
 Many advances in alchemy, philosophy and government came
from the partnership forged between these two like-minded
races. The pages are too worn and rotted to read more of
the history but there is the beginning of a journal entry
on a later page by a blacksmith of Tarion:

    Never before had I seen such craftmanship and a
    clever synthesis of materials as managed by the
    Dragon Tamer smiths with their weapons. A shield
    made from a giant tortoise and a dragon's horn,
    hewn from a dragon whelp, had been fused together
    with a sticky...

 Here the torn paper has become too worn from the raging
desert sandstorms to read any further.

targe~

 The targe's design makes it more suited for attacking than
defending. Ettins learned to fear the maniacal, charging
Dragon Tamer's: wielding large broadswords and their round,
spiked targe.
 Though most would argue that the teeth and firebreath of a
dragon represents its most dangerous features, the Dragon
Tamers of Helventia have forged unique weaponry with dragon
horns at their heart.
