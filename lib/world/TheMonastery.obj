ring gemini~

  As you gaze into the many facets of this lustrous ring, reflections
and stabbing veins of light assail your eyes.  It seems to soak in
the surrounding energy and magnify it many times on its own.  This
is a piece of the enigma that is the Crystal Daemon, a shard of pure
innocence.  The band is encrusted with crushed rubies the same as
the Daemon's very eyes.

E
star~

  The shape of a star, the sigil of Gemini, radiates twin beams of
light from either side of its points to signify the duality behind
its creation.  Bestowed upon the Daemon, the light is magnified to
the infinite.. Good and Evil bestowed in one power.

  Within the blue metallic band, swirls of creamy ivory permeate

a flat and etched representation of a cross in the center.  This
is the insignia of one of the highest mystical beings, carried
only to supplement his power and signify his completion of the
training.  An inscription has been carved carefully into the
inner surface of the band.
