Beyond the mountains~
   Beyond the mountains the landscape is dry and flat. Your gaze follows 
rolling hills of sand and rock to the horizon. There is no water to be seen and
you can only see a few plants in this arid place. Behind you the Spine of 
the World towers to the sky.

of direction. How can anyone navigate through this lands? You have walked 
for hours and you feel very thirsty.  You dont think anyone could live in these

The threefold lands~
   The hills of sand and rock are all around you and you have lost your sense
of direction. How can anyone navigate through this lands? You have walked 
for hours and you feel very thirsty.  You dont think anyone could live in these

Cold Rocks Hold~
   You stand inside a huge cave and after the burning sun outside it actually
feels cold in here. This must be the closest you can get to an aiel "city".
Many smaller caves in the huge cave wall house houndreds of aiel and
in the back of the cave you see water running down over some large rocks 
and into a small pool.

On top of a slope~
   You stand on top of a slope leading down to a vast mist. How can there even
be a mist in this hot weather? All over the slope you see aiel tents. Aiel walk 
around and some ready their spears when they see you. You can hear 
someone mutter the word, wetlanders.

A slope~
   Tents cover the slove well down towards the dense mist. White clad Aiel
run around doing choirs and carry buckets of water. Some carry firewood
for the evening meals. These must be servants, but the look as hard as 
the warriors.

Wall of mist~
   Before you a wall of dense mist strech long as you can see in each direction.
There must be something magical with this mist keeping it from evaporating.
Up the slope to the north you see all the aiel tents and the people walking 
about.

  As you get out of the fog you walk onto a dusty street. No wind have left the

south the only left standing. It looks as it can fall every second as well,
the way the walls stand at an angle leaning on a huge piece of stone
from a ruined wall section. A window in the wall is shattered leaving large
pieces of glass along the edges.

walls have fallen in and bricks and dust cover the floor. The door on the 
southern wall is still intakt though even if the hinges look rusty. The 
windowframe on the northern wall is also intact although the glass is broken.
