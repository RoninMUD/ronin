chopsticks chaotic destruction rusty iron antirent~
This deadly-looking pair of rusty iron chopsticks is crafted from cruely-forged
dark metal.  A jagged tip adorns each chopstick, sharp and barbed; apparently
by design, use, and perhaps even misuse.  These chopsticks are a hazard to any
that would dare use them as a tool eating, and equally so to those unfortunate
enough to be on the bad side of their wielder.
