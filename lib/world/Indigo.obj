orrery~
The planets are in motion, slowly, around the sun of this system. It is a very
delicate instrument, requiring much patience to learn its quirks. You look
closer at what appears to be an extra moon on a distant planet, but realize it
is a spider dangling from a secure line.~

planet is a small depiction of the planets discovered by Leinard, the tweef
astronomer.~
