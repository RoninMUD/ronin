From the High Counsel Chairman of the Crimson King, Sir Marten of MidWorld:
My minions, brothers, sisters, and followers-

  It has been called to my attention that intruders are on the way.  In this
light, we must prepare for the worst.  A list of orders have been issued unto
me by our highest King, Vermilion the First, and so unto you do I pass these
commands.
  1.  The entrance to the Tower is to be locked and guarded at all times.
      Renewing the gate's flame spell is imperative and if not kept in
      perfect working condition, the King will deal with the person(s)
      personally.

  2.  The keys to the Master's topmost chambers will be kept by the 3 most
      powerful in our number.  Those wishing to apply for this honor must
      bring a resume with at least 4 oustanding murders and assorted crimes
      on their personal record.

  3.  All halls and rooms within the Tower will be patrolled at ALL TIMES.

page1~
  Eons ago, the Great Old Ones fought viciously over the possession
of the Universe.  A consensus was finally reached that none of them
would retain control, but a single "chosen" being was to rule from
the center under their authority.  The Universe was stretched between
twelve concentric portals leading to End-World, and at the center, the
thirteenth portal was to be guarded by a ruler from atop the Tower.
At each portal was placed a Guardian:  Spider, Elephant, Rat,
Kangaroo, Bear, Fish, Snake, Ape, Eagle, Turtle, Lion, and Bat all
ruled their respective areas and kept Evil from entering the Portals.
Among men on the Lower Planes of Reality were placed special beings,
Lords of Light, human by appearance but supernatural in ability.
They were set to recover the land if Evil ever forced its way in
and took hold.  Since then, the world has moved on, and the gunslinger
line continues.

  A note in the ancient High Speech to future generations.
It looks like a lesson of some kind:
"I do not shoot with my hand,
     he who shoots with his hand has forgotten the face of his father.
I do not aim with my hand,
     he who aims with his hand has forgotten the face of his father.
I aim with my eye.
I do not kill with my gun,
     he who kills with his gun has forgotten the face of his father.
I kill with my heart."
