Mimir's Well~
   Shelf after shelf of potions line the wall behind the massive oak counter
top. Dazzling arrays of colors sparkle and wink from the stoppered glass
bottles. The flickering lights reflected off the potions dance around the 
carefully swept and tidy room. The counter top gleams with a fine finish and 
a carefully lettered sign is pinned to the wall next to the door.

The Temple Of Midgaard~
   Gleaming white tile inset with gold and intricate scrollwork cover the
floor of the temple. Columns wrap upwards, exquisitely shaped from solid blocks
of marble; wrapped with glowing runes and detailed carvings, they support the
high vaulted ceilings. Light streams down from chandeliers decorated with 
hundreds of candles, the arms etched with gold and reflecting delicate beams
of light to every corner of the room. 
   To the south a vast sweeping stair, cut and carved from massive blocks of
stone lead down the mound the temple sits atop. To the north the Temple's altar
is visible while an archway to the east leads to a potion shop. To the west can
be seen a small room filled with weapons and armor donated by the citizens of
Midgaard, while a small, curved staircase rises in the corner, leading up to
quiet and peaceful rest and meditation rooms above.

Cleric's Inner Sanctum~
   Flames dance and crackle in the huge stone fireplace dominating one wall.
Deep, soft carpets cover the floor muffling footsteps and the soft murmur of
conversation. Large armchairs are spread around the room in little groups,
perfect for memorizing spells or simply sitting in silent meditation. Tall 
bookcases dominate the walls, filled with ancient tomes bound in leather, 
yellowed pages showing their age. Air currents stir dust motes through the 
air in lazy circles while small brass sconces in the wall give off just enough
light to read by.

Cleric's Bar~
   Light wood furniture gleams under the flickering light provided by many
small lamps hanging from the rafters. A tall bar made of highly polished
marble runs the length of the eastern wall, barstools topped with plush
cushions waiting in front. Brightly woven tapestries hang from the walls
showing scenes of great healers in moments of utter chaos, bringing aid
to those in need.
   To the west the door opens into the Inner Sanctum, the flickering light
of a fire visible in the dancing shadows on the wall.

Entrance to Cleric's Guild~
   Rose bushes grow in prolific numbers outside of the entrance, climbing the
walls and always blooming despite the weather. Branches climb and wrap over the
freizes and detailed scrollwork carved above the lintel, thorns probing for
blood with the slightest touch. A door carved from massive pieces of ivory and
polished until it gleams with an inner light, is set within the bushes. Hanging
above the door is the healers cross; wrought in gold and beautifully enchanted
to be clearly visible from a great distance.
   Back to the east the temple square is visible, open and bright, the temple
gleaming high above. A small cove in the wall reveals a winding staircase that
leads up to the sanctum of healing.

The Temple Square~
   Cobblestones form geometric patterns around the square, different colors 
weaving together in a seamless form teasing and pulling the eye in many  
directions. Stone benches line the edges of the square, tree branches hanging 
over, leaves rustling in the breeze as they provide shade. Enormous blocks of 
stone have been carved into a beautiful sweeping stair that rises up the hill 
to the Temple above. 
   To the west the scent of roses wafts through the air, and a shining gold 
healer's cross is visible above a doorway. The Grunting Boar Inn is to the 
east, its ancient facade standing austere and weathered above the surrounding 
buildings. The noise and bustle of the market square can be heard drifting in 
from the south, while a small stair leads up to the post office in the building
to the southeast.

wide sweeping, marble staircase leads up to the reception area, while to the 
east laughter and noise can be heard coming from around the flickering 
fireplace in the bar. A smaller building to the north has a carving of a rolled
parchment emblazoned with a compass carved into the lintel, while its heavy 
wooden door stands open to the bustle of the streets. To the west the temple 
square is visible with the spires of the great Temple of Midgaard peeking 
over the surrounding buildings.

The Grunting Boar~
   Fragments of light stab through the dusty air casting patchwork illumination
on the seats and alcoves of the bar room. The hardwood floor has been worn
from years of travelers' boots while the bar shows the dents and scrapes of an
endless stream of mugs. A large bar fashioned from the stump of a giant tree
dominates the center of the room. Rising from the floor, the center has been
hollowed out to allow space for the bartender and shelves upon shelves of
liquors and spirits from all over the realm. A small fire casts flickering
points of light to dance on the dusty paintings covering the walls. Depicting
scenes of bravery and horrifying blunders, they cover every section of the
wall, overlapping in a violent collection of images and colors.
   To the west the low door opens into a small courtyard, the doorway to a
small shop and the stairs leading up to the reception area clearly visible
outside.
   A small sign tacked to the face of the bar promises enduring fame and
fortune.

The Reception~
   Muted colors decorate the walls, soft lighting from decorative oil lanterns 
highlighting the hardwood accents in the room. Mirrors are placed in strategic
locations, casting the reflection of the room back on itself giving it an 
openness it distinctly lacks. A small counter is placed in the corner, a tablet
and writing utensil carefully arranged in the center. A step leads through an 
archway behind the counter, a long hallway clearly visible lined with doorways 
to various sleeping chambers. 
To the east a heavy velvet curtain separates a small alcove filled with the 
vaults of countless adventures, current and long since departed.
   A small sign is carefully framed on the wall.

The Bakery~
   Glass windows piled high with fresh pastries and sweets, allow copious 
amounts of light to stream in and illuminate the ovens and work tables covered 
in various types of dough and ingredients. A row of brick ovens, flames burning
bright beneath them, line the back wall, various breads and cookies filling the
air with their fragrant scents as they bake. A large display case displays a 
mouthwatering array of goods, the glass fogging faintly as the steam rises 
slowly from the hot breads.

The General Store~
   Bales of hay and bags of flour and beans are stacked in tall piles and wisps
of straw and husks of wheat litter the floor, swirling into corners with 
passing footsteps or flutters of a breeze. Wooden pegs driven into the 
unfinished walls hold up various tools and trade items that might be needed. 
A long wooden counter, made of unfinished wood, is littered with paper, 
pencils, ledgers and small boxes. Shelves stacked with crates and bags of 
foods, and small items stretch along the wall behind the counter. Small gas 
lanterns, carefully shuttered against fire, cast illumination into the darker
corners.

The Weapon Shop~
   The sharp tang of metal and oil hang heavy in the air, permeating everything
with an industrial scent. Racks of swords and axes create a low forest of razor
sharp edges along the eastern wall while lances, halberds and spears tower over
them their hardwood shafts polished to a deep gloss. Rows and rows of unstrung
bows hang from the rafters, while countless bundles of arrows are stacked on 
tables. A massive countertop sheathed in metal stands at the back, rows of 
dummies and training equipment lining the wall behind. Sawdust covers the floor
soaking up spilled oils and the occasional pool of blood from a careless hand 
or foot.

Main Street~
   A slight breeze rustles the tree branches shading the avenue. Clean, well 
kept cobblestones form the street, no holes or missing stones to trip the 
unwary traveler. A slight curb gives some separation between the street and the
wide sidewalk fronting a row of shops and guild halls. Tall, brightly painted
and decorated buildings are set back giving the avenue a clear view of the sky 
overhead. 
   To the south a shimmering arch of blue flames marks the entrance to the 
Guild of Magic Users, while to the north a door leading into the magic shop 
opens and closes of its own free will. The wide avenue leads west towards the 
gates of town and east towards the Market Square.

Market Square~
   The image of a compass is embedded in the cobblestones of the
square, while a tall, carefully carved fountain bubbles away in the
center. Clean and bright, the square is surrounded by beautiful buildings
and is busy with the every day life of Midgaard. As the central square 
in town, and one of the crossroads of the world, there are streets leading
off to adventures in all four primary points of the compass.
   East and west the avenues are lined with shops as they lead out of
town, while to the north and south smaller squares are visible with many 
different buildings and shops nearby. In the distance the mighty, iron
bound gates of Midgaard are visible standing open and welcoming.

The noisy cry of a variety of animals is apparent to the south, a store window

egging them on. The avenue continues east towards the walls, while the noise

constantly materialize and disappear without container or customer before them.

flames, walk around the room looking for someone who might sit down. A 
newspaper sits on a table near the fire, pages turning on their own, waiting to
be read.

support numerous helms displaying beautiful crests of ferocious animals or a

   Long, splintered gouges in the floor clearly show the passage of swordsmen 
casually carrying their weapons to and from the practice yard. Small slices and
scrapes in the bar and furniture give evidence to the haphazard lifestyle many 
lead. Brightly colored flags and family sigils rustle slightly against the wall
as a breeze wafts through, or someone's hurried passage causes a swirl of air. 
Stout tankards filled with ale line the counter ready and waiting to be quaffed
by a passing knight or squire. 
   From the doorway to the south the sounds of practice swords and the clang of
shields resonates through the air. An archway to the west leads to the entrance

   Stout, upright posts decorate the outer edges of a wide open courtyard. Deep 
gouges and notches decorate every surface of the posts, evidence of years of 
squires and knights-in-training. Hard packed dirt provides a solid surface for 
practice. Long strands of thick, hempen rope mark off a large square in one 
corner, practice swords and shields stacked against the pillars. Practice 
dummies armed with splintered wooden shields and padded swords stand grouped 
together against the wall. Thick stone walls rise high around the edges of the 
courtyard trapping the scent of sweat and dust in the air.
   An open door to the north leads back to the bar, fresh cold beers standing 
in tankards on the counter.

   Soot and refuse stain the buildings. Mounds of trash and discarded items 
fill the gutters, water and waste running freely amongst the holes in the 
street. Tall, dilapidated structures blot out the sky, looming close overhead 
they cover the alley in perpetual shadow. Small fires flicker in dark shadows,
dark misshapen lumps moving nearby.
   A square of golden light shines from a doorway to the south in sharp 
contrast to the gloom of the surrounding alley. The sounds of boisterous 
conversation and the occasional scuffle drift through the air. To the east the 
broken cobblestones and worn down buildings of the common square are visible. 
A nondescript building to the north appears run down and deserted, the only 
hint as to what lies within are the clean and glistening, slightly curved 
swords hanging directly above the entrance.

The Common Square~
   The common square of Midgaard is less busy and hectic than the Market Square
to the north. People often pass through here on their way to another part of
the city, their conversations drifting past at all hours of the day. The less
fortunate citizens of Midgaard make the Poor Alley to the west their home,
while the not-so-scrupulous ones frequent the Dark Alley to the east. The
southern gates leading out of the city are to the south. Near the center of the
square a series of floating stone steps spiral into the sky, the Auction Hall
floating a few hundred feet above the patterned flagstones below.

The Dark Alley~
   Steam rises from piles of refuse and human waste, drifting lazily up between
the tall buildings packed cheek by jowl along the narrow street. Muddy water 
flows in tiny rivulets along the cracked and worn cobblestones, pooling around 
the clogged drains and meandering its way down the alley. 
   To the south a low doorway, shrouded in shadow, hides the entrance to the 
Thieves guild. Boisterous voices and the sounds of drinking come from the 
Nomad's guild to the north.

Entrance Hall to the Guild of Thieves~
   Alcoves and small nooks decorate the hallway, no light penetrating into 
these cubbies. The ceiling rises high above the dark floor, rafters 
invisible above the dimly flickering lamps. The occasional dark, oddly shaped
stain is barely visible in thick wooden floor.
   A low lintel frames the door to the east, the dim outline of a bar visible

Countless glass bottles line the shelves, tightly stoppered against foreign
substances and dangerous powders.

  Bright lights reveal every corner and object in the room. The sawdust

wood. Locked and unlocked strongboxes sit in rows on tables against the wall, 
lock picks and other small tools laying scattered about them. In the far 
branches and leaves are stacked in baskets, large and small coils of rope 
hanging from the wall nearby. Heavy wooden shelves hang from the walls, rows 
and rows of dark glass jars, carefully labeled and itemized, tightly corked and
arranged facing the room. Thick dark substances, and clear liquids give some of
the jars a sinister look, small hard round pills and powders looking somewhat 
less threatening, fill the rest.

The Scrapyard~
   Nestled between the quiet groves of the northern forest and the sturdy walls
of Midgaard, tucked away behind a thin veil of scraggly trees, lies the city's
scrapyard. Piles of accumulated junk have been stacked here haphazardly amongst
trees. Broken stone, bits of decaying trash and twisted pieces of rusting metal
are strewn about with little care.
   Midgaard rests to the southwest of here, its towering spires just visible
over the tops of the trees. To the north is a small forest glade, while a
well-travelled path running north and south makes its way through the woods to

   A cacophony of noise fills the air as dogs, cats, birds, and a variety of 
exotic animals chime in, forming a blend of unique sound. Clean, polished tile 
covers the floor which slopes slightly towards a small drain in the corner. 
Rows of cages line one wall, a variety of cats and dogs peeking their faces 
through the bars. In the window a large open box wriggles and bounces as 
several puppies and kittens attack each other in play. A parrot perched 
overhead lets out the occasional squawk, showering them in feathers and 
obscenities. A counter in the corner hold a variety of insects all crawling or
slithering their way up the sides of their displays, trails of ooze and strands
of web showing their numerous failed escape attempts.

bright light on the stuffed and mounted forms of countless animals. Close 
personal companions to many of the worlds greatest Nomad heroes, they have 
been brought here to guard the training home of future generations. 
   Carved trees form an arch to the east that leads out to a shady grove. To

over the Main avenue of Midgaard. Massive wooden gates, bound with thick iron 
bands, stand open welcoming adventurers from around the land. A guard shack is 
carved into the wall on each side of the roadway, providing minimal shelter 
from the weather.

grazing amongst the debris.

waste piled high amidst unkempt grass and weeds. A fence, broken boards and 
posts scattered along a small ditch, marks the boundary of the road. 
   To the east a small alley way carves its way between the sagging faces of a 
few buildings, while the road leads south along the wall towards a footbridge,

litter the walkway. The reaching limbs of dead trees and spiny backs of ragged 
bushes line the roadway in an ancient attempt at beauty. 
   To the north a well kept building, thick marble face stained a deep blood 
red, looms amongst the detritus. The smell of hay and livestock drifts from the
south, where the stables of Midgaard stand open wide to the street. The alley 
continues east towards the Common Square, while the western wall of Midgaard

Above the riverbank~
   Dark swirls of muddy water fill the cracks in the street, a dank, rotten 
smell drifting through the air. Mud and refuse mix together to form a unique 
substance mounded into small drifts around the still standing water. Shrubs and
trees line the side of the alley, their branches sagging heavily, leaves a 
sickly mottled yellow color. 
   Amidst all the detritus of the alley the Paladins guild radiates a soft, 
peaceful glow. Clean scrubbed marble lines the stairs and columns supporting 
the intricately carved facade. Healthy green bushes and small trees, out of 
place amidst the decay of the alley, line the walkway leading to the golden 
entryway to the north. To the south the banks of the river gently slope toward 
the slow moving current.

collapsing as if from the ever present weight of the wall. Loose gravel lies 
strewn across street and yards, blurring the line between street and property. 
Weeds and grass poke through the gravel in a few patches, fighting for survival
amongst the rubble.
   Unpainted boards cover some of the larger holes in a small warehouse to the 
south, some extra boards propping up the walls and patching the leaking roof in
an attempt to minimize leaks. Green, brown and mottled black paint cover the 
face of the small, trim building to the north. A pair of crossed swords hang

slowly cropping the grass.

   Dirt and mud cake the splintered floorboards of the common room. Broken and
discarded furniture lay smashed in a heap near a fire pit ringed with rough 
stone, a small hole in the ceiling allowing small swirls of smoke to escape. 
Small black pellets cover the bar, roaches and mice scampering to and fro 
amidst the damp stains of beer and whiskey. A slightly tilted shelf holds a 
few bottles of booze, a round keg laying on its side dripping foam and beer 
from its tap sits on the floor. Small candles sitting in puddles of their own 
wax are set fixed to the countertops. From the kitchen, the scent of burnt 
onions and garlic wafts through the stale stench of beer and smoke.
   The crooked door to the north leads into the dirty alleyway which cuts

dot the soft ground, water trickling in to each depression. A small stair, cut
from the side of the hill and lined with rock, leads from the alley above down
to a rickety wooden dock reaching out into the slow moving current.  Strangely,
a series of red-carpeted steps also rises from the north bank and leads to a

mounds of coiled hempen rope piled high nearby. A rack on the far wall holds 
ancient harpoons, spears and numerous other weapons of the sea. Small life 
rafts and countless oars of various shapes and ages lay stacked near the 
waters edge in a careless heap. The masthead and spars from countless wrecked 
and decommissioned vessels hang from the rafters, the torn and tattered colors 
still stirring in the heavy air.

keeping the bridge brightly lit in the darkest of nights. The river rushes by 
far below, twisting and turning amongst the rocks and pilings of the bridge, 
the waves throwing a light mist into the air. 
   The bridge connects to a wide open concourse on the south, trees and benches
spaced evenly along the river. On the other side, the road follows the western

is carefully constructed. Smooth and quite sturdy, it is dotted with small 
murder holes and archery slits. The teeth of a thick steel porticullis hang 
below the narrow cut in the wall, hovering and waiting to slam quickly 
downwards in event of attack. Small indentations in the wall provide shelter in
the event of inclement weather.

By the Temple Altar~
   Radiant and magnificent, the statue of Odin rises high above the floor of 
the temple. Carefully carved, and imbued with magic, the statue radiates a soft 
glow. A golden circlet rests on his brow while his ever watchful ravens Huginn 
and Muninn, delicately carved from the deepest onyx, perch on his shoulders. 
The vaulted ceiling of the temple rises high over his head, etched with gold 
filigree and inset with the beautiful crimson color of hundreds of rubies, it 
rests upon massive columns of marble. Hundreds of candles hang from massive 
silver chandeliers, polished until they reflect the light of the candles back 
around the room in a sparkling dance of color.
   Glossy marble floors and the forest of columns stretch south through the 
Temple of Midgaard while to the north, huge doors covered in brightly polished 
gold lead to the gates of Midgaard.

A river~
   Dark water, filled with the refuse and waste of the city, swirls slowly 
east. Small currents form eddies in the low embrace of the muddy banks. Thick
forests of reeds, choked with twigs and grass, bend and dance in the soft 
current. 
   To the west, the muddy bank oozes its way up to the open face of a warehouse,
as the river slowly drags itself east towards the ocean.

A river~
   Deep and cold, the river meanders east, swirling into small coves along its 
banks, dragging downstream the reaching arms of a bending willow tree. Small 
rivulets of city waste drip down from gutters high along the banks and adding 
to the constantly mixing scents of water, refuse and mud.
   Up above, the city walls are visible rising above the steep banks, the 
current pulling eastwards towards the ocean. Upriver to the west, the banks 
ease slightly and become more accessible.

The estuary~
   Salt and wind mix with the city smells in the water. Mud banks and piles of 
silt and trash form small islands diverting the river into reaching tentacles, 
grasping for the ocean. The surrounding mud flats glisten wetly, waiting for 
the next tide to come in and wrap them in its watery embrace. Birds and small 
mammals dart and flit amongst the reeds and mosses growing in the silt covered 
banks. 
   To the west the river gets darker and muddier as it flows away from the city
of Midgaard, its walls visible high above in the distance. Breakers crash and 
recede to the east, the wide open ocean stretching into the horizon. A cluster 
of small treetops are barely visible peeking over the horizon far beyond the 
breakers to the east.

are neatly swept into piles along the curb waiting to be picked up. Clean 
benches form resting places along the street, small trashcans and water 
fountains easily accessible to all travelers. 
   The enormous gates to the city stand open and welcoming to the west, while 
to the north a clean, well kept building houses the Midgaard Jewelers shop,
ornately wrought steel bars over the windows providing extra security. To the 
south, the bright clean glass doors and windows of the Flower Boutique stand 
open to the street, light and air flooding the shop and whisking the mingled 
scents of fresh flowers out into the street.

of visual delights. Racks of seeds and bulbs stand in the corner, small hand 
painted pictures of the flower each produces pinned above the bins. A small

the wall at the back, barely visible amongst the fauna.

into the underbelly of Midgaard. Small stone planters, filled with blossoming 
flowers and tiny shrubs, line the curb and illuminate the walk with color. 
   The faint tinkle of music drifts from the north and south, a small shop 
standing open to the north holds musical instruments of every variety, while to
the south a small set of richly decorated pipes hang below a sign proclaiming 
the entrance to the Guild of Bards. The large gates of Midgaard are visible to 
the east, while westward, the road leads towards the center of town and the 
Market Square.

of simple wooden furniture are set against the wall, providing a waiting spot 
for those who would use the shrine in private. Small tapers stand in holders 
around the room, casting glimmers of light into all the corners. An iron rack 
stands next to the door, pins and slots holding several swords and shields. A 
simple cross, wrought in pure gold, hangs in the center of the room. 
   At the north end of the room a simple archway leads through to a small room,

   Deep black walls create the illusion of an infinitely swirling darkness

burning deep within the solid black stone. Thick red carpeting supports 
ornately wrought iron stands, preserved skulls of many different animals and 
crusaders of the light mounted upon their spiked tops. High above, lost in the 
cavernous gloom of the ceiling, a light breeze whispers amongst the rafters, a 
thousand screaming souls echoing back across the room. 
   Blood red light emanates from a small passage to the north, the textures in 
the wall casting a fractured shadow on the floor.

   Hundreds of mirrors around the dark paneled room reflect the light of a 
dozen braziers, small fires burning in their bowls. Two pools, black water 
swirling in chaotic confusion, flank a narrow walkway. The walkway, made from 
solid black stone, leads straight to the foot of a dark statue. Tall and 
foreboding, its face hidden deep inside a dark cowl, it looms over the room. 
A massive spiked mace, matted with bone and gore, drips blood from its left 
hand. The right hand is stretched out, fingers reaching towards the pools in 
the floor. A pillar of flame burns hot behind the statue, its fiery tongues
licking upwards in a lost battle against the gloom-shrouded roof.
   To the south the narrow walkway reaches through a small doorway into a dark 
passageway beyond.

twisted shadows amongst the armaments. Stark institutional white decorates the 
walls, the only bow to ornamentation of any kind is the enormous banner of 
Midgaard, a black field, the great serpent of Midgaard coiled about the mighty 
figure of Odin and his ravens stark white in contrast, "Fram den hons" 
embroidered in red stand bold across the bottom. 
   To the east a steel door opens into a wide open room, the flags of

cause little trills of sound to emanate from the various instruments. Floating
across the air, the sounds dance and mingle in a haphazard symphony of sound.

large display cases hold items of every type. Suits of armor, weapons that 
glow, hum, or hover slightly above their shelf stand next to curiosities such 
as a small bracelet made from slugs, a stained loincloth from a sumo wrestler, 
even a small star fashioned into a ring and flashing its dazzling spectrum of 
colors around the room. Heavy locks fasten the heavy oaken cabinets closed, and
a small ornately carved desk sits in the corner a ledger with stacks of numbered

the Temple square, and over the rooftops of the southern city. Across the 
vaulted ceiling an intricate painting of Sane shows him charping loudly to a 
throng of followers, in his uniquely majestic fashion. Tall dark bookcases 
display the seemingly endless collection of symphonies, sonnets and poems 
written by Valkyrie and patiently awaiting their first buyer. Framed in gold 
and mounted in a place of honor, the tiny footprint of Leo gleams with a soft
angelic glow.

corner, and on it rests a leatherbound ledger chronicling deposits and 
withdrawals from each vault. Floor to ceiling iron bars seperate the room from

Sanctum of the Vanir~
   White tile covers the wide open expanse of floor. Soothing yellow walls
reflect the dim light of a dozen gas lamps onto the numerous beds lined against
the walls. Tall wooden partitions seperate the beds from one another, clean
pillows and sheets showing sharp folds on each corner. A small wheeled cart
holds medicines and bandages, fresh clothes, and sterile wipes. Faint music 
fills the room while a soft, warm breeze seems to carry a waft of fresh air 
through the room.

The Smithy~
  Thick stone walls trap the fierce heat from the forge. Hard packed dirt
covers the floor, dusty footprints showing a well-trodden path to and from 
the furnace. Two massive anvils are set upon blocks of wood, bound with thick
iron straps and occupying most of the room. Nearby barrels are filled with 
fresh water, salt water and oil, and a few partially finished items rest 
inside, having been dropped in to temper. The wide open mouths of the forge 
glow red hot, sparks cracking and popping in the air. Thick leather bellows 
pump air, the few lumps of steel glowing white hot amongst the embers. Racks of 
armor and weapons are stacked on a table in the corner, awaiting final 
gilding, decoration, or hilt wrappings.
   Thick wooden double doors lead North to the Armoury and the Avenue of
Midgaard.

The Hall of Rewards~
   Small wooden chairs are lined in rows, facing down towards the front of the
room. A small wooden platform faces the seats, a tall lectern positioned
carefully to one side. Gas lamps provide bright illumination on the platform
and the numerous boards behind it. Pictures and information about the heroes
of the realm adorn the walls, both past and present; alongside them are murals
depicting victors from the great chaos quests of the past.

A Glade in the Forest~
  A thick carpet of pine needles covers the small path leading from the
Northern Trail. A strong smell of trees and dirt permeates the air. Racks 
of stretched and drying animal hides stand firmly embedded in the dirt near the
center of the glade. Scraps of meat and leather dot a beaten and weathered
table, dark red stains and deep gouges marring the table where corpses have been
skinned and sectioned into cuts of meat. 
   To the east a small ramshackle dwelling is visible, its walls listing
slightly in the soft dirt, the trees to the west are sparse enough to allow
a glimpse of the Northern Trail

Grobyan's Tanning Shack~
   Cracks and holes dot the walls and ceiling, the wind whipping into the small
shack and swirling around the room. Piles of partially dried skins are stacked
in haphazard clusters around the floor. A sturdy rocking chair sits in one 
corner, a rusted shield and mace laying on the floor close by. A thick wooden 
table dominates the center of the shack, a stack of fresh and bleeding skins 
hanging from the edge. A small cot is tucked against a wall, a ragged sheet 
draped casually at the foot, several clusters of flies hovering nearby.

Entrance to the Training Grounds~
   The towering southern gates to Midgaard rise to the north, its iron-bound
wooden doors only closed in times of deadly peril and extreme chaos. The city 
walls stretch off to the distance far to the east and west. A lively brook 
flows through here and under a small, but sturdy, stone bridge.
   To the south is a small field, well-known for its plentiful supply of
rodents, insects and other relatively harmless animals.

A Map Maker's shop~
   Dimly flickering lanterns provide the only light against the dark wood
paneling of the room. Dust is heavy in the air, stirred occasionally by a light
current of air or someone passing. Books and rolled maps fill various 
shelves and cubbies, cluttering the walls and different sections of the floor 
with seemingly unorganized chaos. Various tables and writing desks are 
scattered around the room, while a long counter occupies the greater portion of
one wall. A small, hand lettered sign hangs from the heavy beams criss crossing
the ceiling.
   A room filled with countless maps and cubbies is visible through a low, open
doorway to the north.

A Map Maker's Library~
   A very large hardwood table dominates the center of this room.
Small cubby holes line the walls from floor to ceiling, filled with 
endless numbers of different parchments maps and notes. Stacks of 
unsorted maps are strewn around the room in disarray. Two rickety 
wooden ladders lean against the shelves to help reach the cubbies near
the top of the wall. Every available bit of wall and counter is covered
with papers of one sort or another.
    Through the door to the south the mapmaker's shop is visible
and beyond that the facade of the Grunting Boar.

The Sanctum of Eternity~
   A vast chamber occupies the northwestern corner of the Temple of Midgaard,
its mysteries closed from view by a large engraved stone door set in the
eastern wall. Carved ironwood pillars spiral upward, supporting the chiseled
slabs that comprise the ceiling far above. Delicate runes glow a ghostly white
from a series of archways set between the columns, their soft light casting no
shadows of their own. Tall silver candelabras, inset with jade and golden
filigree, have been set strategically about the room. Set within these are
slender blue candles, their gently-flickering flames providing dim illumination
to this quiet place. Upon the floor, arranged in neat rows, are simple linen
pillows for sitting or kneeling upon. No tapestries or works of art decorate
this room, their distractions undesired by those that come here for inner
reflection and meditation. A single piece of furniture is set far back and
centered in the chamber, a grand throne carved from a single massive block of
evergreen wood. The Sanctum of Eternity is the realm of Immortalis, Guide of
the Fates, and his throne is forever occupied by his majestic form.

Scattered everywhere, willy nilly, are lots of strange gadgets that
apparently do nothing.  A sign on the wall catches your attention.
