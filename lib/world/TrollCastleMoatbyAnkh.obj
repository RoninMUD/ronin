parchment~

 Midgaard historians had been surprised to find that the
sentient lizards had created a written language given that
their speech is indecipherable to the human, elf, dwarf and
halfling ear.
 Unfortunately, very few have learned how to read the runic
symbols or distinguish between the many, slight variations
in hissing sounds that comprise the spoken language.

 The muddy parchment is covered with a series of intricate
symbols; none of which look the least bit familiar.

kudzu~

 Although it appears quite mundane, this plant has actually
been imbued with the magic of elven artisans. The wood elves
are as much a part of nature as the trees, their enchanted
armour reflects this kinship. The kudzu draws strength from
the sun and the warmth of the flesh around which it binds.
