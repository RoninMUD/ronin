bulwark~
Carefully crafted from blackened hide of a formidable Shadow Demon, this
shield is a masterful example of armor smithing. A layered web of
shimmering silvery metal creates a supportive lattice beneath the dull,
and seemingly flimsy surface. The hide itself seems to offer little in
the way of protection, but is slowly bleeding shadow from the latched
edges of the shield, indicative of the power once held by the beast from
which it was taken. The silver web of metal used the latch the shield to
your arm gleams with a brilliant sheen, and seems to offer as much, if
not more protection than the body of the bulwark itself.

lock hair~

  You see a bundle of long, dark hair wrapped up with a
leather band.  This hair is Luthien's.. at least it was
before she cut some of it away as a gift to the owner
of this lock.  It shimmers in the light before your eyes..
