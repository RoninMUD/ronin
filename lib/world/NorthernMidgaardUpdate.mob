Tocka the Wizard Wonder~
Tocka the Wizard Wonder shuffles along the counter mumbling quietly.
~
Drab robes covered in moth holes hang limply from his gaunt frame. Once
a tall man, his back is stooped from the weight of his tall pointed hat. Gnarled fingers
bend and twist forming intricate patterns that no longer have meaning. A small dribble
of spittle runs down the side of his chin as he mumbles quietly.

regimental flag. Deep set eyes peer out from immense cheeks that sag down to
a triple chin that waggles ceaselessly. Thick calloused hands are covered in

from a sling on her wide hips.

Dorje the map maker~
Dorje the map maker sits here shuffling through a stack of dusty papers.
~
The Map Maker is a hunched bespectacled old man, hands cramped
with age and arthritis. His white shirt is covered in ink blotches while a
flashy pair of red suspenders holds up his worn slacks. A bit absent minded
he waves a hand toward the sign hanging from the ceiling.

A wizened cartographer~
A wizened cartographer is here pouring over his maps.
~
   Thick glasses frame the cartographers face as he peers down at his maps.
Steady hands hold his tools as he mutters about north, east, up, boulders, 
rotten logs and an underground river. Oblivious to the world he happily lives
in the world of paper, lines and rulers. His hands are very steady as he 
carefully inks notes on the margins of his latest work.

fido dog~
The beastly fido~
A shaggy coated mutt sidles along the walls, alert for any scraps of food.
~
   Dark matted fur drips urine and chunks of feces on the ground. Decaying
chunks of meat and intestine hang limply from broken and rotted teeth. Yellowed
eyes roll wildly from beneath busy brows while the curved arch of sharp ribs 
poke up under thick skin.

sellsword mercenary rogue~
A shabby sellsword~
A shabby looking sellsword wanders around, looking desperately for work.
~
   Worn leather adorns a thin jerkin and small coif hanging by a thin line
around a dirt covered neck. Hard eyes and calloused hands twitch nervously in
a sporadic twisted habit formed after years of battlefield surprises. Worn and
rotting boots show many patched and worn holes, filthy leggings tied up with
twine and covered in thick pig grease.

The Vault Guard~
The Vault Guard stands here.
~
   A tall, dark and handsome brute with brawns but no brains.  Imported
directly from the far Kudzul-Ur jungles to the south, he knows no fear.
He really doesn't, the tribe has no word for it.  He watches your every
move out of the corner of his eye and you shiver ever so slightly at the
thought of facing this monster of a man in combat.

Freyja the Healer stands tall and striking, watching over her wards.
~
   White robes hang delicately from delicate shoulders. Long dark hair hanging
in long tresses from beneath a carefully pressed white cap. Thin lips twitch 
upwards in a slight smile as bright blue eyes twinkle with hidden amusement.
A soft light is ever present, carefully wrapping her in a warm golden glow.

   Grobyan, while he has a foul temper, seems to love his job as he's
bedecked in an amazing assortment of hides, as well as the shell from
some sort of turtle and he's wearing on his head a makeshift helmet
made from the head of some giant ant.

immortalis guide fates~
Immortalis, Guide of the Fates~
Immortalis, Guide of the Fates, sits here upon his mighty throne.
~
   Immortalis, also known as the Guide of the Fates, resembles a man of massive
proportions and ageless identity. Corded muscles ripple beneath the loose white
robes worn easily over his mighty frame. An endless series of delicate runes
have been woven into the lining of the garment with metallic thread. Long
silver hair hangs majestically from under his simple platinum crown, his
chiseled face and ice-blue eyes clearly visible between the cascade of
strands. Elegant leather sandals adorn his feet, buckled ankle-high. A ring of
platinum and of similar design to the crown on his brow adorns a single finger
on his left hand, its meaning unknown to all but its owner. As old as time
itself, Immortalis has sat here upon his mighty throne, observing the world and
its citizens, and giving guidance to the Fates themselves.
