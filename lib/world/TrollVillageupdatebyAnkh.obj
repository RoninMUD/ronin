talon~

  This large green item came from a very big half-lizard.  He caused you
a lot of trouble, so upon killing him you dismembered the corpse.  As
you were disposing of the remains, you noticed that this talon made you
feel more powerful when you picked it up.  Deciding it would make a good
souvenir, you slipped it on and upon returning to the town discovered that
it was magical.  As you look closer at the bone, you notice some faint
scratchings near the tip in some odd language.

 The illegible scrawl covering the paper makes it difficult
to tell which way it should be oriented to read. There's no
hope of deciphering the writing without magical aid.

staff~

 A few worn sections of the staff reveal a pseudo-solid
silvery metallic substance beneath the gold plating. The
metal or liquid - discerning its form at any given time is
impossible - looks extremely valuable.
