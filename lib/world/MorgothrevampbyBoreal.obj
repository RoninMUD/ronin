book~
The page is fashioned from cured skin, its surface etched with ink the color of old blood.
The script twists and crawls as you read, each rune heavy with funerary weight.

The Ninth Silence is not broken by will alone.

To awaken what lies beyond the veil, the tome must be made whole.

Upon the Sacrificial Altar, lay the relics of the Nine Paths 
The marks of Warrior and Cleric, Thief and Mage, Paladin 
and Anti-Paladin,Ninja, Bard, and Commando each sacrifice 
a memory of what once lived.

Bind them to this grimoire, that their echoes may be stitched together
in defiance of the grave.

When the altar has drunk deeply, speak not a prayer, nor a plea,
but a single command, uttered with purpose and finality:

RISE

Only then shall the dead remember how to obey.
