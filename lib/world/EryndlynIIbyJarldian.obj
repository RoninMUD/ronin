cauldron~
Here lies a caldron filled with blood from the faithful drow elves that 
worship their Queen.  Matron mothers, high priestesses all come here to
offer a tribute....in BLOOD.  They all slit their wrists and allow the blood
to drain into the caldron, as a sign of favoritism.  Usually required, however
unusual requests from the queen can only be answered with additional blood.~
