Lumall Keep Builder's Guide, Vol I
May 12, 1995 Gregorian

     This Guide stems from the fact that there are four people all 
working on the keep right now.  As with any project to be completed
over the Internet, some guidelines need to be established, or the Lumall
crew will fall into one of the worst pitfalls of MUD: building a non-
cohesive world.

     The way it works:  Lem slaps down the world iteself, putting notes
into a new rooms desc filed so that the writers will have a general idea of
what that particular room or section of an area should look like.  The next
step is for the writers to polish those notes up into a desc and make the 
room interesting or exciting.  Next, Lem looks it over, because he's 
neurotic...then the proofreader checks it, as does everybody else :)

Lumall Keep Builder's Guide, Vol. I
May 12, 1995 Gregorian 

     This Guide stems from the fact that there are currently 4 people 
all working on the Keep, who hopefully will continue working on the 
entire world surrounding the keep.  As with any project to be completed
over the Internet, some guidelines need to be established, or the Lumall
crew will fall into the worst pitfalls of MUD:  building a non-cohesive
world.

     The way it works:  Lem slaps down the world itself, putting notes
into a new room's desc field so that the writers will have a general idea
of what that particular room or section of an area should look like.  The
next step is for the writers to polish the notes up into a description
instead of a long string of words and half-phrases and make the room 
interesting or exciting.  Next step:  (usually) is Lem looks at the room
because he's neurotic and makes sure that nothing is amiss, and that most
of his specs have been basically met or exceeded...read the next section

Rules

     Ok, the main rule on this job is don't step on anybody's toes.
People are writing here, being creative -- you may have a great idea
or suggestion, but deciding that somebody's room description isn't
cool enough or anything of that nature isn't for you to do.  What you
_should_ do is discuss it with the writer, or with Lem.  That way, your
objection or suggestion gets heard, but doesn't bruise any of our
delicate egos.  The only time you should edit somebody else's work 
without clearing it with the writer or with Lem is when you see a typo
or a grammatical error -- but keep as many words from the original desc
as possible :)  Basically edit out the mistakes, but change ONLY the
mistakes.

  -- Don't edit the zone, this will screw Lem up beyond all belief.  The
Keep has about 40 rooms so far, 45 reset commands, and that's without
mobs or objects.  Anything that needs to be fixed, just tell Lem about it.

Lumall Keep Builder's Guide, Vol. III
May 13, 1995 Gregorian

Rules (cont'd)

  -- Don't chat up the area, give details on the area, etc.  Our goal
is to drop about 800 rooms into the mud as a finished project, with 
no-one but ourselves (the keep crew) knowing what to expect.  Coupled
with the new class system and most likely ongoing changes in the class
or classless system, as well as some old areas being rewritten, ronin
should boom like a mining town when we drop the area into place.  
There's a reason for the G-man being the first mob in the zone, even if
it is a sick one :)

  -- Don't change exits or make exits.  This will also screw Lem up
completely, as well as making him foam at the mouth.  Feel free to change
door names and door descs, but make sure there isn't one already there :)

  -- Use your common sense.  Don't do anything foolish :)

Guidelines

     Ok, there need to be some kind of standards set so that the material
in this world is somewhat similar to the rest of it.  

  -- If you mention something in a desc that would be an item were the room
real, make it into an extra-desc for the room.  It's tiresome to see in a
room desc, "There is a grand-looking throne in the center of the room." and
then when the player types, "look throne" he gets back "You do not see that
here.  What?  i thought there was a grand-looking throne in the center of
the room...Easy to do this extra-desc.  Say there is a table.  "A long
maple wood table dominates the main area of the hall."  "l table"  "You
glance at the table, and sense in it the beauty of craftsmanship."  or even
l table : "You see a long maple wood table."  ANYTHING vaguely related
will do, so long as it's not, "You do not see that here."

Guidelines (cont'd)

  -- Unimportant rooms don't need to have alot of time spent on their
desc's. For instance, you should spend more time on the king's office
than on the broomcloset in the servant's wing.

  -- Try to keep in mind that this is a huge castle, it's all indoors,
and there is no electricity -- if a hallway is lit, mention a lamp or
torch every few moves...lamps for the richer hallways, torches for servant's
quarters, etc.

  -- Keep in mind that hundreds of people live in this keep.  Phrases 
many years have passed since last this room was entered should be saved
for use on rooms in the furthest reaches of the dungeons, not for the door
to the main kitchen :)

  -- Don't ever use the word "guilded."  Ask Lem about this if you don't
understand.

May 13, 1995 Gregorian

Guidelines (cont'd)

  -- All rooms long descriptions' first line should be indented 3 spaces.
to do this, start the new line with a backslash...otherwise, no spaces at
the newline.  This indentation is necessary to break up the room desc from
the room name.


  -- Try not to use the phrases, "You feel"   "You sense"  "You see"
...instead, use "this room"  "off to the west..."   ...etc.


Addendum to the Rules Section:  Never edit a room name.
