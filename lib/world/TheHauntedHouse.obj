	12th of Dwinletton

	He has come to me again, my secret friend. I am so disappointed that I
	can't tell about him to my sisters. He says it would ruin our little
	secret. Always when he comes, he tells me stories of faraway places and
	secret things. I wish I could go with him someday. Today he promised to
	bring me something from afar. We talked late in to the night, and then
	he left, changing in to a handsome black bird, to fly away.

	14th of Dwinletton

	When I awoke in the morning, I found that he had brought me a gift. It
	was wrapped in beautiful black cloth, and was tucked under my pillow.
	I was awfully excited when I opened the red silk ribbon that tied it
	together. There was a gem encrusted knife inside. It was so beautiful.
	I was very happy, for my friend had kept his promise.~

	16th of Dwinletton

	I had an awful nightmare last night, about huge black things with sharp
	teeth. They came in to the house and killed everyone but me and ...
	oh... I can't bear to remember it again. It was so horrible. I am glad
	it was only a dream. 
	I miss my friend, because he hasn't showed up since the day before 
	yesterday, when he brought the gift.

	17th of Dwinletton

	I had that horrible nightmare again. This time my friend was there too,
	trying to save me by talking to there heinous creatures. And it worked,
	he just talked to them and they went away, to save me. Then suddenly I
	woke up. I don't know what awakened me, but I swear there was something
	in the room with me. I was so scared that I just closed my eyes and 
	pretended to be asleep.

	19th of Dwinletton

	Something awful has happened. I awoke in the middle of the night in a
	dreadful pool of blood. It was everywhere. I ran screaming from my 
	room, but nobody answered. After a while I found my sisters and father,
	but they were all dead. Killed in their sleep. With a knife, and when
	I searched for my knife, it was missing.

	20th of Dwinletton

	I have thought about yesterday, and what happened then. Considering the
	fact that I had 'slept' for almost a day, and my knife was missing, I
	have come to the conclusion that I killed them. There just seems to be
	no other solution. With this load on my conscience, I can't bear it any
	longer. Goodbye, dear diary. God bless.~
