...an archaeological marvel.  If the texts are to be believed, this doorway is
where the ancients first stepped into our world.  It might not tell us what
happened to them, or why they abandoned us, at least not directly.  But maybe
it can give us a better understanding of where they came from and that's a
start.~

...taken years, but we've finally opened the portal.  We're not even sure how
it works to be frank, but it clearly does work.  And if we understand
correctly, it leads to the birthplace of the ancients.  The bureaucrats leading
the project are prescribing caution.  The cowards.  They are afraid to step
into the future.  Well I'm not.  We go through the portal today.~

...is amazing.  From our vantage point up here, we can safely view the
rudimentary machines.  They look very much like the ancients we know, but they
behave completely differently.  Largely we're ignored.  Other times, they
attack without any rhyme or reason.  Communication has been absent It's why
we've taken to calling them machines.  As far as we can tell, they are ancients
with no awareness.~

...deemed us a threat.  Every attempt to explore deeper into the cavern has
failed. We're detected as soon as we go in and harrassed until we leave.  We've
tried to be avoid direct combat so far, but we're not being given much of a
choice.~

...hiding in this fissure when attacked.  It appears to be a bastion of safety.
After harassing us non stop, the buzzers turned back instead of following us
in.  Perhaps they fear this place?~

...press on.  It's our best chance to observe the worker machine.  It's what
we've taken to labeling the crawlers and diggers.  We're not clear on what
they're doing and why, but they're bent on a task.~

...obelisks that amplify the efficiency of energy gathering.  It's not as
refined as the machines themselves and obviously not alive, as far as we can
tell, but this group of towers is a machine in itself.  The scripts throughout
the cavern funnel energy, but these obelisk some multiply what's gathered.  The
science is beyond us, but even if we don't understand how, perhaps we can still
copy it.~

...a master copy if you will.  Our finest minds believe the other machines are
imperfect copies of the original.  Their combat abilities are terrifying to
behold.  What's worse, I dont think it's by design.  They are not made to
fight, but our military is so single minded that a conflict was forced upon
them.  The fight was over before it started. Fortunately, we didn't have to
beat them.  It was simply a distraction.~

...leading biologists are convinced it's an infection.  Much like how blights
have ravaged the great forests, these growths are ravaging these deep ruins and
machines that inhabit them.  It's hard to comprehend.  The machines are so far
beyond us.  What can humble them?~

...breakthrough.  Our empaths were of no use until this point.  Somehow, the
infection changes the machines enough for limited communication to be possible.
The replicator is a beginning for them, a catalyst of sorts, but it was co-
opted by another race.  Something different.  Older.  Hardly recognizable as
life.  Now the machines serve them.~

...less than nothing to them.  Even their motivations seem alien.  Growth for
its sake. The machines are tools to serve their purpose.  We're vermin.  No,
that's not right.  Weeds perhaps?  An annoyance in need of purging.~

...could not fight them directly, but they showed us how we might. The energy
being funneled serves to keep a portal open to the virus' home. We can remove
the safeguards, destabilize the flow of energy.  It's suicide.  None of us will
survive.  And it will only buy time.  Our deaths will set their progress back.
May the rest of Ronin use that time wisely.~
