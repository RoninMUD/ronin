This is a no-nonsense blade, as befits its master Musashi. The katana seems
to resist and object to practice swipes through the air, seemingly aghast

eyes~

  As you examine the "eyes" more closely, you almost see a flicker of
light in them.  Unsure if it was your imagination you look more closely
and after another few seconds you see it again.  Feeling a growing sense
of something watching you, you feel that you have perhaps underestimated
Hachiman, and wonder if you might have to battle him again some day.

~
E
ring yawata band~

  This ring had once belonged to Hachiman, the god of war. He fought
viciously to protect this ring, and you remember the battle well.
Though you were disappointed at being able to actually kill the being,
you were more than happy to claim your prize.  As you feel the pure
vitality that is emitted from this ring, you can't help but wonder
if it was this that eventually made people think of him as a god,
rather than his skill in battle.  The memory of his decapitated corpse
at your feet makes you believe it was the former.  There are two small
emeralds in the band that look almost like eyes.
