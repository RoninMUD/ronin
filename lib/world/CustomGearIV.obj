vambraces~
Crafted through an ancient method that relies on arcane forces to
heat the steel and the brutal strength of beasts to forge the metal
to shape, these vambraces have long survived the test of time. Forged
from a material that has always been a rarity, if not a myth, this
armor was enscribed with eldritch runes that contains the essence of
shadows, powerful enchantments strong enough to bless the wearer with
the ability to move outside of sight and sound.

greaves~
Quite literally crafted from the very essence of shadow, calling this
a piece of armor is quite the misnomer. Ancient eldritch magic cannot
explain the means by which darkness itself is gathered and made
tangible, yet the inexplicable is present before your very eyes. By
whatever means these greaves were forged, they are no more something
that is worn than something that remains unseen, concealing the user
in a sheathe of pitch-black darkness that suffuses their being and
creates an effect that makes them perpetually difficult to follow.

stone~
The Stone of Agrion was forged by none other than the legendary High
Alchemist of the former city of Darujhistan. Lost to war and tragedy,
the famed city was overrun in the ravaging conquests of an Empress
who has been forgotten by history. Yet Agrion's name remains, due to
the unmatched feats of alchemy and blacksmithing he performed during
his 287 year lifespan. This ring was crafted from a smoldering ember
taken from Mount Esteri shortly after it had erupted and drowned the
people of the Nermud Plains in living magma. It is but one of a pair
forged by collecting the lost life essence of the Esterin people and
masterfully chiseling the ring from molten rock.

gauntlets~
Crafted by master smiths from an age lost to legend, these gauntlets
were forged for a cadre of battle-mages who eventually met a tragic
end. Set upon by a particular vicious horde of abyssal demons, the
squad of battle-mages had attempted to banish these outsiders to
their home plane, only to be met with the mocking reality that they
possessed only a fraction of the power necessary to do so. The
reamins of these mages were haphazardly gathered by lesser minions
and stored in a fetid pool of waste, only to eventually be discovered
one day when a marauding squad of celestial avengers was performing
a routine purge of the fourth circle of Hell.

gauntlets~
Crafted from the remains of a ghastly apparition, frozen in physical form
through some sort of malevolent alchemy. Rather than allowing the spirit to
pass into the next world, its phase-shifted hide was carved into strips, as
a leather crafter would handle the hide of an animal. Untold anguish must
have been visited on the spirit in question as its very existence was torn
asunder, a deep malevolence seems to seethe from within the confines of
these gauntlets as you turn them over in your hands.

carapace~
Legendary beasts and champions have long held fear of the volcanic chambers
of the daemonic Pit Viper. Many adventurers have ventured into the hallowed
halls of the unholy depths of the earth in search of these creatures, only
to be devoured completely by the denizens held within. Fewer still have
managed to reach the deepest depths and come face to face with these
nightmarish creatures, and even fewer have stood to face them and managed
to walk away. One of those fierce combatants carried the enormous hide of
this monstrous serpent, and through even fiercer sorcery, was able to
craft it into the masterwork shield it is today. Fused with the unholy
terror of the daemon it was created from, this carapace serves as both a
substantial defense as well as the source of otherworldly powers to those
who would choose to invoke irrevocable harm unto others.
