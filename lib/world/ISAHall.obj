ale irish stout beer frosty bottle~
This tall bottle of frosty Irish Stout Ale, was mass produced
in a beer factory in Lorien. There small, under paid elvish
children are forced to work long hours brewing 'Irish' beer
for sale exclusively at the town of Fortress. A few years 
back an adventurer named Stanach came across a small brewing
operation in the hills and discovered the the brew wasn't 
half bad. After buying out the company he moved it to Lorien
where, after striking a deal with Galadriel he began
mass producing the ale. Each beer has its own special, secret
ingredient added to give it just the right flavor. 
That ingredient is known only to the members of ISA.

Years ago, a wandering adventurer came across a fountain of water high
in the southern mountains. After drinking of the liquid he noticed
that he was more protected, monsteres shied away from attacking
it was as if someone was protecting him. After an earthquake
sundered the mountains the fountain was thought lost forever,
however shortly after the building of the city of Fortress
the fountain was discovered, hundreds of miles north of its
first sighting point. Who knows who brought it here, or why
but its properties remain the same.

Brewed by Grulg in the depths of the ISA Castle, this dark brown
brew has properties that allow the adventurer to tolerate
an immense amount of pain after quaffing. No one knows how
Grulg convinced Podo to sell his brew, but once it hit the
shelves, Grulg has barely managed to keep up with the demand.
All the members of ISA know is that late at night, muffled
explosions and loud crashes come from the depths of the
castle dungeons.

its conscience goes, but who knows what other awareness' it has.
Granting those brave enough to quaff it the ability to see into 
the infra spectrum, this potion is quite rare and very handy.

Found by a wandering minstrel in a swamp west of midgaard, this fruit
falls from a tree with silver bark. While out wandering, in search of
an audience, the minstrel stumbled into a grove of these trees. 
Caring nothing for their value, and obvious magical properties she
ate of the fruit and pocketed the seeds until such time as she would
have a place to plant them once again. Years later, when she heard of
the wizards gathering plants and trees for these gardens, she was 
reminded of the seeds and traveled through the Eternal Blizzard to 
make a gift of them to the wizards who cared for the gardens.

These flowers grow exclusively in dragon lairs. The magical properties
that dragons exude, cause these flowers to flourish and bloom with
remarkable tenacity. Over the years some of the properties inherent in
dragons have come to imbue themselves in the flower, such as its natural
warmth, and unusually deep burgundy color. Kept alive through the magic
of the gardens, these flowers are an astonishing contrast to the frost 
and snow.
