This oddly colored book was obviously written by a druid (that probably would
explain the color) and discusses various trees and such that live in the forest.
One thing that does catch your eye is a chapter about telling which trees are
able to cast spells. Apparently, Eucalyptus trees and the trees that "shiver"
do not cast spells, but the trees that "moan" do.

nobody knows what started the fighting (not even they remember anymore), some
historians believe it has something to do with the death of a Roo princess and
an Aborigine prince.

encyclopedia book r~
   This book is just packed with creatures and items that begin with the letter
R. Some of the entries look like these:
Rat- there are many varieties of rat (flying, sewer, wererat, ...) you will
   also discover that while not all, a few are good eatin' if you cook them
   properly (the radioactive rats are sought by the best chefs).
Rapier- a useful weapon, it can really help get your point across if you get
   in an argument.

   a rock musician.
