A Mountain Path~
This narrow path winds precariously along the rugged face of the 
mountain, bordered by jagged rocks and sparse vegetation clinging 
to life. A brisk wind howls through the air, carrying the scent 
of pine and snow. The path is uneven, littered with loose gravel 
that crunches underfoot, and the sound of distant birds of prey 
echoes faintly from above.

The Base of Morgoth Mountain~
The base of Morgoth Mountain is a sprawling expanse of shadowed rock
and dense forest. Towering cliffs rise ominously overhead, their 
dark surfaces jagged and foreboding. Small streams trickle from cracks
in the stone, pooling into crystal-clear basins that reflect the 
imposing summit. The air is thick with a mix of earthy moss and cool 
mountain breeze. Dark and ominous before you, the mountain beckons 
you onward.

The South Face of Morgoth Mountain~
The south face of Morgoth Mountain is a sheer expanse of treacherous
rock and crumbling ledges, bathed in the harsh light of the sun for 
most of the day. The winds here are relentless, tugging at every step
and whistling through narrow crevices in the stone. Sparse patches of 
hardy moss cling stubbornly to the cliffs, and the occasional mountain 
goat can be seen navigating the perilous terrain with surprising ease. 
Below, the view stretches endlessly, revealing a sprawling valley 
dotted with forests and shimmering rivers, while above, the 
mountain's spire reaches skyward, veiled in swirling mist.

The lower slopes are a mix of dense, windswept forest and rocky 
outcroppings. Pine trees tower overhead, their branches swaying 
in the constant breeze. The ground is uneven, with roots snaking
across the trail and patches of soft moss providing a rare moment
of comfort. The air is filled with the scent of pine and damp 
earth, and the occasional rustle of leaves hints at unseen wildlife.

Temple Choir~
A raised platform at the rear of the temple, the choir area is marked by
its intricate woodwork and scattered, splintered pews. A massive organ 
looms in one corner, its pipes dented and silent. Faint carvings of 
celestial beings are visible on the walls, though their faces have 
been weathered away by time.

Temple Apse~
The apse is a semicircular alcove bathed in an ethereal glow, its domed 
ceiling adorned with faded frescoes. A weathered altar stands at its 
center, its surface scarred and stained from years of use. 
Candles, some long melted, are scattered around, their wax frozen in 
chaotic drips down the stone.

Beneath the altar lies a hidden chamber, accessible via a rickety 
ladder. The air here is thick and stale, heavy with the scent of 
damp stone. Shelves filled with forbidden tomes and crumbling scrolls 
line the walls, and a single, flickering torch barely illuminates 
the rooms secrets. Emaciated figures are chained to the walls
with iron chains and collars.

Golgothan Ruins~
The Golgothan Ruins stand as a crumbling monument to an age long 
past, their weathered stones intertwined with wild vines and 
creeping moss. Scattered among the debris are ancient graves, each 
marked with a simple stone slab etched with faded names of 
long-dead heroes. Broken statues, once proud sentinels, now 
lie in disrepair, their faces worn smooth by centuries of 
wind and rain. The air here is heavy with reverence, as if 
the spirits of the fallen still guard this place, whispering 
their forgotten tales on the breeze.

Golgothan Ruins~
The ruins are a solemn graveyard for legends, their broken arches and
toppled towers overshadowing rows of ancient tombstones. Each grave is
marked with a weathered epitaph, some bearing the names of heroes
whose deeds were once sung across the land. Stone cairns and rusting
relics rest atop the burial sites, silent reminders of the sacrifices 
made here. Time has ravaged this once-hallowed ground, but the faint 
hum of a forgotten hymn seems to rise from the earth, carried 
by the wind.

Golgothan Ruins~
Beneath the fractured spires and crumbling walls of the Golgothan 
Ruins lie the graves of those who once shaped the fate of empires. 
These resting places, now overgrown with weeds and wildflowers, are 
scattered haphazardly across the landscape. The faint carvings 
of swords, shields, and crowns on the grave markers tell of 
warriors, rulers, and sages who earned their eternal rest here. A 
faint glow emanates from certain stones, as if the heroes spirits 
still watch over the desolation, guarding the ruins from whatever forces
would disturb their peace.

Golgothan Ruins~
   The walls here are covered in cobblestones, hiding within the remains of
the ancients who once roamed these hallowed grounds.  The musky scent 
of death and decay permeate the air, and you struggle to contain your gorge.

Golgothan Ruins~
These ancient ruins lie in eerie silence, their towering stone columns
cracked and covered in dark moss. Faint traces of long-forgotten glyphs
are etched into the crumbling walls, hinting at the dark rituals once
performed here. The ground is uneven, strewn with rubble and broken 
statues that seem to watch with empty eyes. The names on the graves
have been lost to time.

Golgothan Ruins~
Amid the crumbled walls and toppled columns of the Golgothan Ruins
lie the graves of heroes who fought their last battles in defense 
of a forgotten kingdom. These burial mounds are adorned with 
shattered weapons and rusting helms, tributes to those who rest 
beneath. Weathered inscriptions, nearly illegible, tell fragments 
of their valor. An eerie silence hangs over the site, broken only 
by the soft rustle of wind through the sparse grass. The very air 
here feels sacred, as though the bravery of the departed lingers 
as an unseen presence.

The Ossuary~
This chamber is a grim testament to death, its walls lined with neatly
stacked bones and skulls. The air is cool and still, carrying the faint
scent of dry rot. In the center, a massive stone reliquary stands, its
surface carved with macabre symbols and adorned with offerings of melted
candles and coins.

A Dusty Cave~
This dry, desolate cave is coated in a thick layer of dust that rises
with every step, forming a choking haze. The air is stifling, and the
walls are rough and barren, save for faint scratch marks that hint 
at past inhabitants. Occasional gusts of wind disturb the 
silence, carrying a faint whisper through the empty space.

A Twisting Staircase~
This spiraling staircase seems to go on endlessly, its stone steps
worn smooth and uneven by countless travelers. The walls are narrow
and claustrophobic, with only the occasional torch bracket providing 
dim light. The faint sound of footsteps echoes up and down the 
staircase, creating an unsettling illusion of company.

Temple Narthex~
     The twisting staircase above empties out into this room deep inside
the mountain.  An unnatural warmth permeates the room, and you hear a low
buzzing sound, barely more than a whisper, emanates from the walls.  Ignoring
this noise, which drills into your skull, you notice a truly enormous set 
of double doors o the south.  Sculpted from granite, these doors appear as
immovable as the mountain itself.

The Dirty Mage's Hut~
   The wind rips through the clapboard walls of this shambling, poorly
constructed shelter.  This ramshackle building is home to a hermit with
complete lack of organization and sanitation.  Tucked into various nooks
and crannies are various implements of magic, including herbs, spices,
minerals and even a few books written in some strange language.

that must surely be their mother.

An Earthen Tunnel~
The tunnel is rough-hewn, its walls packed with dirt and tangled roots
that hang like natural curtains. The ground beneath is uneven and 
damp, with occasional puddles reflecting the dim light from flickering
torches. The earthy smell is strong, mingling with the faint 
scent of decay.

   The tunnel continues on as you reach a turn, stretching to the east
before you.  The silence continues here, and your heavy boots leave
tracks for anyone to see.  The occasional spider crawls into your path
and your eyes drift upwards, watchful for any spiderwebs.

   Reaching yet another turn in the tunnel, you wonder if this path is
turning back upon itself.  The walls are slightly damp here, perhaps 
there is an underground river nearby causing the increase in humidity.
ever mindful of the dangers you've already faced, you keep your mind
focused on what's yet to come.

   The pathway here takes a sudden dive downwards, and the ground 
tries to give way beneath your feet.  You can see that someone long ago
cut terraces into the decline, and you carefully wind your way from
step to step as you sink ever deeper into the mountain.

   The earth on the floor and walls begins to give way here to a more solid
stone. Your footsteps begin to echo, and to the south you see a dim glow
as your torches reflect off of a shiny material ahead.  Guttural voices drift
to you, but surely nothing can be living so far beneath the mountain.

The Dolemen~
The southwest corner of the Dolmen feels darker and more foreboding.
The marble here is black as night, veined with streaks of crimson 
that seem to shimmer when viewed from the corner of your eye. The 
air is heavy and still, and the carvings here depict jagged, claw-like
shapes intertwined with scenes of destruction. A low, almost 
imperceptible growl seems to emanate from the stone itself, as 
though some ancient force is watching and waiting.

The northwest corner is dominated by a broken stone pillar, its jagged
edges jutting upward like a jagged fang. The floor here is littered 
with fragments of marble, the largest piece bearing runes that glow 
faintly blue. A strange chill permeates the air, and the faint scent 
of frost lingers despite the stillness of the environment. The walls 
are adorned with carvings of storms and swirling winds, their sharp 
edges and chaotic lines contrasting starkly with the otherwise 
orderly designs of the Dolmen.

The walls here are lined with intricately carved niches, each containing
a small marble urn engraved with strange symbols. The floor is composed 
of polished stone tiles, some bearing deep cracks that reveal 
faintly glowing veins of crystal beneath. At the far end of the 
chamber, a large archway stands sealed by a massive slab of black 
marble, its surface marked with a single glowing rune that 
pulses rhythmically, as though waiting for a specific touch or 
incantation to unlock its secrets.

The Dolemen~
The heart of the Dolmen is an expansive chamber of polished 
marble, its smooth surface gleaming faintly under the dim, magical 
light that emanates from the walls. Massive stone pillars encircle 
a central altar carved from a single block of pristine white 
marble, its surface etched with intricate geometric patterns and 
ancient runes. The air is cool and dry, carrying a faint, metallic 
tang that hints at the latent power coursing through this place. The 
silence here is almost oppressive, broken only by the occasional 
echo of dripping water from somewhere deep within the stone.

The northeast corner is dominated by a tall marble monolith, its 
surface inlaid with veins of shimmering silver that pulse faintly 
in the still air. The floor here is uneven, the stone cracked and
fractured as if by some ancient force. Tiny fragments of quartz 
glimmer faintly in the crevices, catching the ambient light. The 
carvings on the monolith depict celestial patterns, their precise 
alignment suggesting a connection to long-forgotten 
astronomical events.

The floor slopes gently downward toward a recessed basin, its edges 
lined with intricate depictions of fire and molten streams. A faint 
hum fills the space, as if the chamber itself were alive with 
dormant energy.

something ominous lies just beyond.
