note page letter~
All of my efforts to get money to the starving
workers at the midgaard mob factory have failed
so far, but I have one final option. I have
located a pack of were-crocodiles who have
tunnels leading to the midgaard sewers, I will
attempt to buy the use of these tunnels to
deliver the money myself. Wish me luck.
