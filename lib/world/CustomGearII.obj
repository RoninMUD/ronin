tone~

  The Harmonic Tone is a physical manifestation of the essence of music.
It swirls and changes shape constantly, emitting various musical notes
at seemingly random intervals.  It hovers slightly and seems to evade your
efforts to touch it, but somehow it stays with its owner.  Every so often,
a familiar tune can be heard from the tone, but as soon as the tune is
recognized, it reverts back to the random musical notes.

The end of the handle is looking like a head, and the
handly itself is make like a snake. Along the almost
completely black blade, you see the edges glowing with
pale blue flame. As you look back at the head you
hear a faint cold voice speaking to you, almost
like the wind blowing chilled air through the leaves
of the trees. You could swear that the eyes on the
handle blinked at you there for a second.

  This Glove is made of a black, silky material and seems to be

it is commonly known as, was originally found by Ronin's first
Ninja Shogun.  Rumor has it, that when the Shogun was slain in combat,
the Glove absorbed some of his powers and subsequently bestow those
powers on whoever wears the Glove upon their hand.  Whether this
story is true or not, those who wear SwiftKill often find themselves
fighting with precise skill and quickness very similar to the Ninja.

  The vambrace appears to be made of metal, but it is unlike any
metal you have seen before.  It is silvery-gray, almost looking like
gold, and extremely hard.  There are small spikes along the length of
the armor, allowing it to be used as a formidable offensive tool as well.

all along the edge of it.  The fan itself is red with motifs of both
a Phoenix and a Dragon embroidered with the liveliest of colours.
The ribs are made from the finest Chinese stainless steel and wink
at you as the sun illuminate them.  It seems very old and worn,
