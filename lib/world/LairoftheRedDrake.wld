A smooth tunnel~
   Dark, glassy walls curve smoothly to the floor. Condensation beads along
the walls as tiny rivulets of water curl into the darkness. Warm bursts of
steam float upwards through the tunnel carried along by wisps of air swirling

   A small cleft in the wall leads east into the darkness, while the water
slick walls curve downwards into the heavy blackness below.

   Darkness presses in from the glossy black walls. Steam and warm air rush
quickly upwards, twisting and writhing through the tube shaped tunnels, rising
higher and higher towards the surface. The faint smell of rotten eggs drifts
along the curving tube, wafting lazily along the swirling rush of steam.

Entrance to a molten chamber~
   A massive arch of roaring flame and geysers of lava looms above a small,
arched footbridge of black, glass like rock. Rushing streams of molten rock
stream beneath the arch, flowing quickly into a boiling lake beyond. Dripping
flame streams from the ceiling as the tunnel crushes downwards, barely keeping
its shape in the intense heat.
   The bridge leads south into the center of the fiery room, while to the west
the tunnel works its way back through the molten bowels of the mountain.

A molten chamber~
   Black rock forms a small ledge overlooking a boiling lake of molten rock.
Geysers of flame and explosive pillars of sulphurous gas shoot upwards blasting
against the glowing red and white ceiling. Massive, soft chunks of rock slough
off the wall, crashing into the boiling lake and sending waves of lava
splashing around the chamber. Intense heat blasts upwards, echoing the groans
and grumbles of the mountain as it pushes outwards, seeking a way to escape.
   The narrow black path leads northwards into the winding tunnels below the
mountain.
