shell~
The crafting of makeshift pieces of equipment is the mark of a successful
adventurer, or so they say.  It is obvious that the creator of this particular
item didn't quite grasp the concept.  This helmet has been carved from the
shell of an ordinary pumpkin, or so it would seem.  Dozens upon dozens of
layers of thick lacquer have been applied inside and out, in an apparent
attempt to keep the structure rigid and prevent it from decaying.  Two large
eye holes have been cut into the shell, a bit off-kilter, and a jagged mouth
greets observers in a macabre grin.  Though the entire headpiece looks rather
ridiculous, it does offer a fair amount of protection to its wearer.  On top of
that, it certainly adds a degree of intimidation-factor to whomever puts it on.

druid sickle~
This Druid Sickle is forged in a damascene pattern with beautiful 24k ornate
gold inlay of alchemical and druidic symbols making its way towards the tip
on both sides of the curved blade. The blade is forged in a half-moon shape
with a double edge towards the tip.

The handle is pitch black, carved in ebony and polished to an extremely
high finish. The handle has been ergonomically shaped to fit its owners hand
perfectly. Celtic and typical animalistic druid motifs have been intricately
carved into the handle, making it seem quite lively and at the same time
providing and optimal grip - even with the hand soaked in blood and
entwined in guts.

The sheath is made in unicorn hide, stitched with spider-silk for optimal
durability. Druidic motifs and Celtic patterns have intricately and
painstakingly been carved into the sheath. An eagle feather is hanging
from the pommel of the sickle, enabling the sickle to draw the powers
of nature from its surroundings.

seemingly maintaining all of their original arcane potency. What can be

exoskeleton bone armor hive queen esar~
  This set of armor seems to be constructed almost entirely from the fragmented remains
of the Hive Queen's exoskeleton.  The carefully reconstructed bone plates have been
fashioned to resemble a set of plate mail armor, the surface of which is blackened from
extended exposure to acid and flame.  Each plate has been connected to the next by a
complex set of metallic hinges, seemingly made from darksteel or another metal of
similar shade and texture.  Etched with acid and magic into the surface of each bone
plate is a complex set of mystical runes that connect to form a pattern across the
center chest plate of the armor.  Your eyes slowly become accustomed to the rythmic
pulsing of the runes and you are able to make out what seems to be a design in the
shape of the Hive Queen's deadly tail sting.

The epitome of a featureless facial decoration, this mask seems nothing

a bone-white layer of bleached animal skin stretched over a thin plate
of porcelain, it lacks many key elements of a finished work. There are no
eye-holes in the mask, no nose-holes for breathing, no mouth-hole for 
speaking, it is simply an uninterrupted surface with slight hills and 
valleys to wrap around a person's nose and mouth, dips where there eyes 
should be. Intriguingly, the stitching at the outer edges of the mask 
seems to be done in a particularly colorful shade of blue that seems to
glimmer in the light, revealing a rather mystical quality that plants a
seed of doubt in your mind regarding the seemingly innocuous nature of
this finely crafted, yet wholly incomplete vizard.

among the deep gnomes for its utility and familiarity, as it closely resembles
the non-militarized versions used for everyday mining tasks.  This particular
weapon was forged from a rare cache of invaluable ingots, refined from the ore
of a giant meteorite found hundreds of meters beneath the surface.  By granting
this weapon to Damagar, Kikival kept his promise that he would never forget his
bravery or friendship.  Banded together against a common enemy, the drow, the
two stalwart leaders defended their kingdoms.  Damagar had given the life of
many of his soldiers, including his two sons, and lost an eye and a foot of his
own.  How the weapon became lost to Damagar or his kin is now long forgotten.

It is said that in ages past, a dragon king ruled over much of these lands.  The
dragon was so powerful, and so feared, that his servants would obey any of his
orders, no matter their level of depravity.  The king was often prone to fits of
jealousy and rage over the most trivial of matters.  As a powerful dragon, he
could take the form of nearly any other creature, large or small.  One day the
mad king learned of a beautiful giantess and sought to court her, desiring to
make her his bride.  When he discovered she was already taken, he slipped deeper
into madness.  It was then that he ordered both the lady giant and her husband
slain.  In cruel vengeance, he had his best armorer create for him a set of
mighty greaves, crafted from the flesh and bone of the slain lovers.  These
greaves are now all that remain of both the dragon king's legacy and his
unfortunate victims.

fine leather of some beast, which has been tanned, cured and polished to an
impossible sheen.  Bound to the exterior of the vambraces by an intricate weave
of delicate silver bands are a multitude of shimmering green scales.  The scales
are similar in size and shape to those of the largest of ancient wyrms, though
they are much more flexible and smooth.  The shimmering surface of the scales
almost seems to undulate in the light, emulating the ebb and flow of the tide of

Through the ages armor smiths have experimented with nearly every kind of
animal hide for crafting into defensive garments.  One of the more peculiar
experiments was performed by the halfling Jobot Faringsworth and involved the
pelts of hedgehogs.  An untold number of hedgehogs were slaughtered, stripped
of their skins and cooked into a tasty stew.  Jobot's first piece, a loincloth,
did not turn out to be a popular item at all.  A second item was crafted and it
too was discarded, for nobody could grip their weapons while wearing hedgehog-
hide mittens.  Finally, in an act of desperation to save his name and his
business, Jobot pieced together a fine skullcap from the remaining scraps he
had at his disposal.  Though the idea was sound, the damage was done.  Jobot
Faringsworth grew old and sick and passed away, destitute and alone.

It is said that Warlord Ganjo, a fairly chill warlord as far as military
leaders go, found nothing more amusing or entertaining than his pet
platypuses.  Unfortunately, he was also rather fickle and would often grow bored
with this or that.  It was during one of these lulls of boredom that he came up
with the rather brilliant, or so he thought, idea of platypus mortal combat.
Thus began a strange time in his lands of faraway, a time of grooming and
training one's platypus to the peak of its performance.  Spiked armors and
bladed tail bands were crafted, all in the name of platypus gladiatorial
games.  As each weaker animal fell, Ganjo had for himself collected the bill of
the slain beast.  In the end, this too grew tiresome for the warlord, and the
games were ended just as swiftly as they began.  To remember those days, Ganjo
wore a belt crafted from those collected bills.  Warlord Ganjo was slain some
months later by a proclaimer of platypus freedom.

the result of an early experiment with lanterns, blue fire, toilet paper

trio of adventurers ventured into the depths of the Astral Plane in an
attempt to harvest a medium in which the Azureflame could be stored and
carried on a more permanent basis. However, after a less than fruitful

caladbolg runeblade~
Finely crafted from a blackened metal as dark as onyx, this blade is
etched from hilt to tip with a series of dimly glowing blue runes, the
remnants of a long forgotten language. As stories would have it, this
bastard sword began its life as an enormous tooth pulled from the
gaping maw of an equally enormous beast. Shaven down to form the length
of its blade, the ragged root of the canine was capped with steel to
form a handle and it became quite a passable weapon. Though somewhat
impractical due to its weight, it saw much use throughout an age, but
eventually succumbed to wear as the bone was slowly chipped away. Due
to its magical nature, even in its tattered form it would serve as the
core to an even superior weapon. And thus, a blade was molded around it
to create the weapon named Caladbolg, the name of the beast who bore
the canine etched into its surface with an ancient, eldritch magic.

Elemental Plane of Fire, this bracer was the result of experiments
performed by a mage named Kerleth. While Kerleth's inevitable downfall
came at the hands of the very elements he spent his life learning to
manipulate, his legacy would at least live on in the vast collection
he managed to create. This is but one piece of that collection, pilfered
from Kerleth's obsidian tower by a particularly clumsy thief. While said
thief managed to escape the tower in one piece, it was a short-lived
success, as the winged-demon that he had bargained with to gain entrance
to the tower was none too pleased that he had returned almost empty
handed, and set upon him with an infernal vengeance. When all was said
and done, this piece of Kerleth's armory had found a new home: in a pile
of ashen remains.

shield azure dragon rider blue~
Though the design of this shield is simple, it is beautifully crafted from rare
and high quality materials. Round in shape, the shield is nearly a meter in
diameter and is slightly concave from the perspective of the wearer. The
circumference of the shield is composed of a burnished silver metal,
circumscribed with dark symbols of mysterious origin. The nearly impervious
scales of an ancient blue wyrm form the main protective body of the shield. A
metal disc is mounted at the center of the shield, five spokes connecting it to
the outer ring. Attached to the back side of the shield is a simple grip and a
pair of sturdy brown leather straps with heavy buckles. The shield bares little
in the way of battle damage, yet it looks ancient and well-used at the same
time; a testament to its superior craftsmanship. Capable of deflecting the
mightiest of blows, this shield is deceptively light for its size, granting its
wielder a high degree of mobility in the thick of battle.

Dark wisps of shadow have been hammered and bent by some great power
to conform into a circular shape, against the will of the universe.
This ring is hard to look at, its form only betrayed by the light
that it seemingly absorbs from its surroundings. Though it emits no
sound, a dull screeching forms in back of your mind as you cast your
gaze upon its unsettling presence.

In your hands, you hold a shiny golden ticket. The ticket is made of a slick golden
foil material, and its edges are cut into an elaborate wavy pattern. A long diatribe
of legalese, written in graceful silvery lettering, fills much of the ticket. The blurb
goes on and on about redemption rules, expiration dates and possible fines or
imprisonment. Scrawled atop this, in crude childlike lettering, is the following:

pendant sorrow gemstone fine silver chain~
A mortal jewelcrafter, by the name of Marius, was tasked with producing a pair
of amulets for Zeus and Hera. The metal that composes the fine silver chain of
the pendants was sourced from the same ingots used to forge the mighty hammer
wielded by Thor. The gemstones used in the design are said to have formed from
the only two teardrops shed by Hera over the death of Heracles. These amulets
were stolen by some lesser god and were eventually lost to the sands of time.
It is said that the gods that commissioned the pendants were so jealous of
their perfection that they had Marius executed, lest he someday produce a piece
of higher quality.

The cloak appears to flicker and fade, its presence in the physical realm a
tenuous thing. The edges of the cape give it definition, as they smolder and
glow with a dull reddish-orange light. It is said that cloaks such as these
are created when a powerful demon is banished from this world, and are thought
to be composed of the lingering essence of the creature. Perhaps they are just
that, or perhaps they represent a sliver of a connection between this world and
the lower planes. Nobody has dared to find out, lest the demon become aware of
its loss and seek to reclaim its forgotten power.
