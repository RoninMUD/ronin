Fiend Blasphemy~
The Fiend of Blasphemy~
The Fiend of Blasphemy is here guarding his sunken world.
~
Poised before you is a towering fiend, Ruler of this underworld
domain.  At times this awful creature shimmers and you feel
the dank air crackle with its released energy.  Where there
should be a face is a fetureless void.
