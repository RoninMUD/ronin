letter~
..And the Dragon flew high into the air, screaming at the loss
of her son.  Her tears flowed and filled the fountains of the
Pagoda. Her favourite mirror landed near the ring of statues
in the Plaza.  She unleashed hurling balls of fire from her
lips, punishing those that harmed her son.  The walls of the
Pagoda quickly began to burn.  The Sorcerers and Clerics of the
Pagoda quickly retaliated.  They gathered beakers of water from
the fountains, fetched the dragon's mirror, and began to summon
the powerful magic of the ring of statues.  Combining their
forces they created a magical mirror.  Then, with the aid of their
Shadow Master, they reflected a heavenly light which dispelled
the dragon into a magical realm, where she was no longer a
threat. Ashamed of killing the Dragon's son, they created
a statue of the dragon-child in its honour, to be placed at the
top of the Pagoda, so only those strong, brave and worthy enough
could ever lay eyes on it.
