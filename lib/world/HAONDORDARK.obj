branch~
It is very heavy and looks as if it has been dropped from great height.  It is
long and straight and the wood is very hard, still being full of sap.  Although
it does not fit very well in your hand, it could be used as a clumsy but very
heavy weapon.

bark~

 Most of the ancient sylvan runes etched into the bark have
not been seen in centuries and can only be translated by a
learned scholar, or the brownies who shepherd the forest.
However, the familiar runes seems to indicate that this is
a guide to making a piece of equipment which harnesses the
brownie's symbiosis with the forest.

beret~

 This magical, arboreal beret has been imbued with the spirit
of the forest. Brownies have oft been spotted wandering the
dark woods wearing one of these leafy crowns. The enchantment
contained within the foliage makes it bloom only when the
wearer is a known friend of the forest realm.
