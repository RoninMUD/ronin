  This note seems of utmost importance, as it has the stamp of the
  Queen on it!  It says:
    To Anyone,
      I have lost my birth control pills, and I will reward anyone who
      finds them.  Without them I will have many unwanted children.
      You should be able to find the keys (YES, KEYS) to the castle,
      since none of my servants fight for anything anymore, and one
      of them should be around the store room, where I lost it, so
      examine the area CAREFULLY since the dust is very thick there.
      But who cares about fighting?  I'm a lover, not a fighter.
       The last time I saw the other key was on a barrack dwarf.
  Signed, The Queen.
  PS When you find them, tell Depeche, and he will reward your hard
     work.  You must have all the keys necessary to obtain it, also.

The sign says:
              WELCOME TO THE DWARVEN KINGDOM !!!!!
   There are some fun things in here, and if you can't figure them out,
   DO NOT ask a god.  There is a quest involved within here, and your
   first hint is that a dwarf in the barracks is your first clue.  He
   is not willing to share in the prize, so you may have to kill him
   for it.  When you complete the quest, you will be richly rewarded!
   Don't think that it is easy, because it is NOT.  Contact Depeche
   when you have finished the quest, or leave a message on the board.
   PS If you find any bugs, please report them.
