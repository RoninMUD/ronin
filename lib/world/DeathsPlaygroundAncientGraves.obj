tombstone~
A towering, featureless tombstone of smooth gray stone, eerily untouched 
by time or decay. No name, no inscription. Only the faint imprint of 
countless hands pressed into its surface, as if generations of mourners 
have tried in vain to remember the one buried beneath.

tombstone~
A towering, weatherworn tombstone, its cracked surface streaked with 
what appears to be dried tears. Deep-set carvings, nearly eroded by 
time, depict faceless mourners kneeling before a cloaked figure whose 
arms stretch toward the sky. A constant, quiet dripping sound emanates 
from its base, yet the ground beneath remains dry. A protrusion sticks 
out from the center of the tombstone.

tombstone~
A jagged slab of blackened stone, taller than a man, covered in 
deep, claw-like etchings that glow faintly with a crimson hue. The 
inscriptions are in no language of the living, their shifting forms 
never the same when looked upon twice. The air around it is thick 
and metallic, as if freshly spilled blood had soaked into the earth. 
Occasionally, the engravings pulse, and the distant echo of a heartbeat 
can be felt through the ground beneath your feet.
