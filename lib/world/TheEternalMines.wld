Wide rolling plains~
   Tall grass marches slowly up the gentle slope climbing upwards from the
narrow valley riddled with streams and the occasional drooping willow tree.
A soft puff of wind stirs the colorful patches of wildflowers as it races
onwards up the hill, swirling over the crest before plunging onwards.
   To the north the vast open sky stretches over the fields reaching towards
the distant horizon. To the south a waterway laps its gentle current against
the soft grass-covered bank.

Wide rolling plains~
   An ancient tree bends its supple branches towards the wild flowers that
cover the soft ground below. The dried husk of an ancient log provides a small
place to sit, the grassy plains stretching out before the ancient tree, bowing
and dancing in the breeze like a vast army waiting only the orders of its
general before setting out for conquest.
   The rolling sea of grass spreads out to the north, the faint gurgle of
trickling water echoing up the hills to the south.

   Chunks of granite rock force the dirt aside as they push free of the ground's
embrace. Tall leaning spires rest against each other small nets of lichen and
fern clinging precariously to the cracked and pitted sides. A solitary pine
spreads its thin roots across the peak of the rock, grasping and reaching for
a stronghold on the impervious surface.
   To the north a breeze pushes across the open plains, dancing and swirling
amid patches of colorful wildflowers. To the south a tall tree looms over the

A swiftly moving waterway~
   Sediment chokes the river current, brown brackish water sluicing through an
abundance of reeds and grass choking the river bed. Steep muddy banks drop off
sharply into the deep running current, a few roots and branches dipping into
the current offer shelter for a school of fish from the fast moving swirl
of water.
   The crash and gurgle of rapids comes from the west while to the north and
east the river slows into a wider, deeper drift.

A stagnant pool~
   Reeds and rushes choke the current, slow moving water swirls against the low
banks as bugs and gnats skitter across the top of the brown and brackish water.
Schools of fish and small snakes dart about between the reeds, the sucking pull
of deep mud trapping anything that touches the river bottom. Low hanging tree
branches rot slowly as they push their way beneath the surface.
   A muddy trail leads up the bank to the north, small trees and tufts of grass
pushing their way through the muck. The stream swirls east through the choking
dam of reeds and grass, while to the west the current moves a little faster.

   Chunks of granite and tall rocks sprout from the center of the stream, steep
banks funneling the rushing water rapidly downstream. Chunks of rotten logs
break their backs against the indomitable granite spears lancing up through the
stream, splinters bobbing rapidly as they are whisked through the rapids.
   The swift current continues moving downstream to the south, while to the north
the trunks of the jungle split the stream into a fragmented collection of small
waterways.

alive with small frogs and bugs darting to and fro. Large chunks of granite
line the eastern edge, a natural barrier rising up from the soft ground.

Amidst the cresting waves~
   Thunderous waves crest and crash upon each other, tumbling in long rows of
grey and green. Tossing spray across the deep troughs in an endless game,
flecks of foam dancing upon the glassy surface of each watery mountain.
   The rows of white tipped sea-green mountains stretch inexorably towards
the horizon in all directions.

Amidst the cresting waves~
   Heaving swells toss and churn the foaming water as the steel grey waves
crash and rise in endless succession. Bits of froth scatter in the wind as it
swirls through the troughs between the breakers. Bits of driftwood ride the
back of the waves as they build, then crash down into the steel grey water,
bobbing and dancing as the current pushes it farther and farther out to sea.
  The rows of white tipped sea-green mountains stretch inexorably towards
the horizon in all directions.

Amidst the cresting waves~
   White foam races up the back of the rolling breakers, hovering just a moment
before plunging deep into the black depths below. Rows of cresting waves
march indomitably onwards as the wind whips the peaks into a frenzy of white
water. Tons of water heave and undulate as the swirling currents tug downwards
into the black, cold depths.
   The rows of white tipped sea-green mountains stretch inexorably towards
the horizon in all directions.

Against a rocky shore~
   Steel grey waves crash upon the rocky shore of a small island. White foam
explodes outwards as the crushing water searches for a way to break the high
granite barrier ringing the lush jungle. Splintered driftwood litters the shore
crushed by the relentless surf and rising tides.
   A small break in the rock is visible to the north, thick green trees
clinging desperately to the rock face over the pounding surf. Salt spray
glistening brightly on the lush foliage. Rows of white tipped sea-green
mountains stretch inexorably towards the horizon in all directions.
