ring flesh~

  This is one of the most revolting items you have ever seen.  It is the
bone of some now unrecognizable creature that the Witchdoctor has carved
into some semblance of a ring.  There are still small strips of flesh
hanging from the bone, and it is stained with blood.  The smell coming from
it seems to be a mixture of rotting flesh and vomit, and the mixture of the
two creates a horrid scent.  However, the Witchdoctor seemed to gain
something from wearing it, and you figure it is probably worth the effort
as well.
