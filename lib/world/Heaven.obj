chapter_1~
I saw the devil from afar.  He was standing about thirty yards from
my location slaying countless angels.  His power was great indeed.
My soldiers and I charged him from the left side, but our attempt
was futile.  He turned and began tossing magical energies at us and
many of my comrades fell.  The battle raged on for hours, but the
tides turned when Gabriel descended from the heavens to aid us.  He
heroically confronted the devil head on, and as the fiend turned
to direct his attention to Gabriel, Alexander, with Charles's help,
had enough time to imprison the devil in a very powerful magical
prison.  His soul was torn from his body and it slumped lifeless
onto the battlefield.  But the devil survived in his prison, slowly
regaining his strength.....
~
E
chapter_2~
The corpse was torn to shreds.  In fact, as we tore it to pieces,
it seemed to regenerate from time to time.  When it was all over,
we had collected claws, wings, horns, a piece of the beasts torso,
an eye, and a bone.  We separted these remains and took them back
with us to Heaven for proper disposal in the anvil in the Heavenly
Forge.

chapter_4~
Each of the main contributors earned a heavenly reward that day.
Alexander, Kathryn, Kevin, Mark, Jessica, and Gabriel each placed
different parts within the anvil and earned a reward.  Alexander
kept the hammer as a symbol of his prestidge in heaven.  Each kept
guarded the secret of what exactly they put in the anvil, but
occasionally, each has been seen carrying a scroll, with what
they sacrificed written on it.
~

chapter_3~
As we destroyed the remains with the the Hammer of Heavenly
Might by using it on the shriveled body parts which were in
the anvil, a holy light entered the room from above which
blinded us all.  We thought we had angered God, but to our
surprise, inside the anvil the parts no longer existed, but
was replaced by a holy relic as a reward for our heroic deed.
Each survivor received such a gift, something different from
any other, but then again, we all put different combinations
of the remains in to destroy.....

That day I had personally slain a great archdevil.  I salvaged all 4
claws and a bone, but the remains regenerated.  With help, I slayed
the foul beast another time, this time taking the rage which was
contained in the lifeless corpse.  All these items I did put in
the anvil and after I used the hammer on them, I was rewarded with
an awesome sword that helped me in my proclamations of the greatness
of heaven.

Plundering the battlefields of a great battle, I did discover the remains of
many dead archdevils.  From some I took pieces of the dead beast as a trophy,
but the others instructed me to destroy them at the anvil.  I did end up
doing so and for my efforts I was awarded a holy axe!  I have come to
realize the power of this axe, but I do miss my trophies : 2 bones, a
pair of wings, 2 eyes, and the rage.

A holy light filled the room and when it disappeared, all that
was left of the remains was a necklace with some heavenly power
