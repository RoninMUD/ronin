parchment~

 Marcus was always fond of the beasts kept in the Crystal
Tower, but his interests were founded more in magical and
alchemical origins rather than emotional. The many uses
for dragon's blood, the strength of dragon-fire wrought
metal, and the teeth of dragons and pyrolisks all excited
Marcus' ambition to create.
 With cunning wizardry Marcus was able to coax the foundry
knowledge from the smithy Ragar. That font of knowledge
had only begun to be tapped when Marcus first helped Kiri
craft The Fang.
 This parchment is the grand conclusion of all Marcus' work
to create a truly devastating weapon: a weapon forged from
mithril, the firey fury of a pyrolisk's fang, and a Flame
Dragon's tooth.

page2~

Considering you relationship with one of the possible donors, I assume you will
be looking for a Pyrolisk in short order.  Lastly, you need a mage to enchant 
an Item to forge the object into the desired form.  To this end, I am making a 
hammer as a gift to you and am enclosing the directions on its use, so that a 
lesser mage can bind the magic to the item in question.  The main part to 
remember is that once you put the components on the anvil, a mage must use the
hammer to forge the components together.  This will release the spell I have 
ingrained into the hammer and the object of you interest will be formed.
  Also, many valuable items can be joined to form an even more valuable item.
The only way to be figure out the right combination is by experimentation.

                                                    Signed, Marcus

                                Kiri-Torin, friend and compatriot
  The enchantment of items is an exacting process, my friend. It is good 
that you are interested in such an undertaking, but you have no idea what 
you are getting yourself in to. 
  First off, the item has to be made of the best material to be found. Since 
the project you are describing is a weapon of power, you must use the 
best metal for a weapon. My advice would be either Adamantite or 
Mithril. These two metals both have the qualities endearing to a blade 
and both are precious enough to be of aid in the enchantment process.
  Second, the enchantment process requires a rare item that has the 
inherent magical properties you are looking for. In this case the tooth of
either a Red Dragon or a Pyrolisk would be advised. Not any tooth will 
do, therefore I suggest the Canine tooth of an elder of one of the two 
species in question.  (continues on page 2)
