This towering ceremonial jar is crafted from blackened clay, its 
surface adorned with gilded etchings of skeletal priests offering
tribute to an unseen power. Thick, waxen seals bind its lid 
shut, each one marked with an ancient sigil of warding.

These jars were not designed to be opened without being smashed.

bookcase~
This once-grand bookcase has long since surrendered to time and
neglect. Its wood is warped and splintered, swollen from
centuries of damp air, and riddled with wormholes that trace
aimless paths through its frame. Several shelves have 
collapsed entirely, leaving only jagged stubs and a 
drift of rotted parchment scattered across the floor.

One shelf, however, still endures.

Resting upon it is a single heavy tome, untouched by the decay
around it. Its cover is dark and thick, bound in cracked leather
etched with faint, almost imperceptible sigils. A thin layer of
dust coats the bookcase itself, yet the tome appears oddly 
clean, as though something has ensured it would not be 
forgotten. The air around it feels heavy and still, carrying 
the sense that disturbing the book may awaken knowledge 
best left undisturbed.

"The Fall of Neraths Order"
When the moon wept its final light upon the valley, the Order of 
Nerath fell, not by blade or siege, but by the slow, insidious 
whispers of decay. What was once a grand sanctum of knowledge 
and power became a tomb, its halls choked with the remnants of 
a failed ascension. The acolytes, bound by their devotion, sealed 
themselves away, their voices lost to time, yet their oaths still 
linger, etched in stone and bone. Only those who dare speak 
the word 'Oathbound' may step beyond the veil, treading the path 
of the forgotten.

"The Nameless Rituals"
Among the forbidden rites practiced in the crypts shadowed 
depths, one stands above all in its terrible potency. The high 
priests of Nerath, driven by their insatiable hunger for 
eternity, wove their souls into the very stones, ensuring 
their dominion long after flesh had failed them. It was not 
death they embraced, but something far worse. A fate beyond 
the reach of gods or mortals alike. To walk their path, one 
must speak the word 'Eternal', for only then will the ancient 
bindings loosen and the way forward reveal itself.

"The Last Testament of Lord Vyrek"
They told us the crypt was salvation. A sanctuary where the 
worthy would be remade in undeath, our wills unshaken, our 
bodies unbroken. But we were deceived. The ritual was 
flawed, the promise a lie. We are not warriors reborn, we 
are prisoners, shackled by our own arrogance, our minds 
trapped in an endless cycle of waking death. If any soul 
yet walks these halls, if any voice dares to defy the dark, 
let them know this: The word 'Forsaken' is both our curse 
our key. Speak it, and the path shall open but beware 
what waits beyond.

"Echoes of the Deep Tomb"
The crypt was not always a place of silence. Once, its halls 
echoed with the footsteps of scholars and the hushed voices 
of those who sought forbidden knowledge. The library, a 
sanctum of learning, held texts so ancient that even the 
gods had forgotten them. But knowledge is a treacherous 
gift, and those who lingered too long among the pages 
found their minds unraveling. The words whispered 
back, twisting their thoughts, guiding their hands to 
rites best left unspoken. Now, only dust remains on the 
shelves, and the scholars who once read these books have 
long since become part of the crypt itself.

"The Buried King"
Beneath the grand sepulchers and crumbling halls, deeper than 
any have dared to tread, lies the tomb of the one they called 
the Buried King. His name has been lost to time, his deeds 
erased from history, yet his presence lingers. They say the 
crypt was not built to honor him, but to contain him. The 
chains of bone and iron that bind his resting place are not 
merely symbolic, but necessary. Some believe he still dreams 
in the dark, waiting, listening, biding his time. And should 
his name ever be spoken again, should his bones be 
disturbed, then the dead who now serve as his jailers may 
no longer be enough to keep him entombed.

sepulcher~
A heavy stone sepulcher rests on the floor, its surface covered in 
spiraling runes that pulse faintly with dormant power. At its 
center, the sigil of the Nerath Priests, a skeletal hand 
clutching a burning eye, stands out among the carvings, its edges 
worn smooth by time. Faint indentations surround the emblem, as if 
awaiting something to be placed within. An eerie stillness lingers 
in the air, and as you gaze upon the ancient markings, an unsettling 
realization takes hold, only by placing the proper symbol inside 
can the ritual seal be awakened.

sigil~
This heavy sigil is forged from blackened metal veined with dull
crimson lines, each groove etched with careful, ritual precision.
The symbol at its center depicts a robed figure standing before 
a crowned skull, its hands raised in both supplication and command.

The reverse side bears a ring of worn script, partially smoothed 
by countless fingers. Though time has eroded the metal, the 
meaning of the inscription lingers, pressing itself into 
the mind of the reader:

The faithful do not arrive as one.
Each must be named. Each must be placed.
Only when the sepulchers remember their priests
shall the High Voice walk again.

Near the bottom, a final line has been deeply scored, as if 
carved in haste:

Set the sigils where the dead are kept,
and the path shall open.

Resting on a pedestal of crumbling stone, this medium sized jar 
bears the markings of an ancient ritual, its surface cracked but
still intact. Faint traces of dried blood stain its rim, suggesting 
the offerings once made here were not only material. A simple lid 
rests atop, unsealed, as if daring the curious to peer within. 
Faint glimmers of something valuable flicker in the darkness 
beyond the narrow opening.

These jars were not designed to be opened without being smashed.

A heavy stone sepulcher rests in the dim recess of the burial 
chamber, its surface worn by the passage of centuries. Faint carvings
of solemn figures in prayer adorn its sides, their faces eroded beyond 
recognition. Dust and cobwebs cling to the edges of its lid, which bears 
the sigil of a long forgotten lineage. The air is thick with the scent 
of decay and lingering sorrow, as if the silence itself mourns those 
entombed within. Whatever rests inside has not been disturbed for 
ages or so it seems.

The lutes strings hum faintly even when untouched, resonating with a
tone too low to hear but heavy enough to feel in your bones. Along
the inside of the soundboard, barely visible beneath age-darkened
wood, is a thin etching scratched by an unsteady hand.

Not all dead sleep in silence.
Some remember the songs of home.
Play not for the living ear,
but for those who linger,
and they will answer in kind.

A final line trails off, the letters warped and uneven

Phaix Nisruth yet listens.

reliquary~
This reliquary is carved from funereal stone, its edges worn smooth
by centuries of ritual handling. Shattered iconography of Nerath's
priesthood spirals around its bodyeach sigil incomplete on its 
own, yet unmistakably bound to a greater whole.

Hairline fractures lace the reliquarys surface, glowing faintly as
if remembering oaths once sworn and later forsaken. When held, it
feels heavier than its size suggests, as though burdened by 
unfulfilled duty.

Along its base, a faded inscription repeats in a looping script:

The oath was spoken before him. The oath must be returned to him.

Beneath the inscription, a final etching stands apart and
unmarred by age:

Only in the presence of the betrayed may the hollow be made whole.
