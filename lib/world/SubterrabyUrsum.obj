A remarkably small glass orb which measures only a couple inches in
diameter. The orb emits an unthinkable amount of heat and light. Although
at first glance the orb appears to be aflame, closer inspection 
reveals the flames to be only an illusory dance of magical light. The orb
is blindlingly bright and obscenely uncomfortable to the touch.
