and you cannot see through the middle which is simply a Blackness like

A few months after he began his training with the monks, Seijiro learned that
the demon had found out that he was indeed still alive and was intending to
finish the job. Seijiro was prepared however, he had learned of a tunnel
beneath the temple and had enlisted the help of the grandmaster in writing
his scroll of binding. Once the demon reached the temple, Seijiro taunted
him by throwing rocks and then quickly fled into the tunnels and waited for 
him. When the demon arrived, Seijiro said 'I am Seijiro and you are dead.' With
that, Seijiro uttered a holy mantra to the gods and brought down the tunnel
behind them, trapping both inside forever.
~

page2~
It is not clear why the demon didn't finish off Seijiro, but the next day a
group of sohei (warrior monks) happened upon him and took him back to their
temple to nurse him back to health. It was only after talking with the monks
did Seijiro learn that he could only stop the demon by using a magical scroll
of binding to trap him underground. Shortly after this, Seijiro decided to
join the monks' order and learn their mystical ways.

This is the story of a brave samurai named Seijiro. For many years of his
life he fought and killed many of the evil creatures that roamed the land.
One day he heard talk of a vicious demon that had recently killed a dozen
skilled samurai. Upon hearing of this, he immediately set out to find and
slay this foul creature. He searched for many days and when he finally caught
up with it, it calmly looked at him and said 'I am Arago of the Shadows and
you are dead.' This enraged Seijiro so much that he attacked Arago in a fit
of rage and was horribly wounded by Arago.
