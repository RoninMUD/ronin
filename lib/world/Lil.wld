of water and a small hand towel to wash the grime from your fingers, sitting
on a small table.  The room is empty otherwise.  Doors stand to the north and
west.

Rolling Hills~
	You left the forest, and have entered the rolling hills south of the
mountain range.  As you look south from the top of a hill, you see little
peaks and valleys continueing forever.  The same view greats you to the west
or east.  To the north way way in the distance, a black outline is all you
see of the mountains.

	You have entered into a small tent, used by the vermin in Ferahgo's
army to stay in the shade in the day, and to sleep in at nite.  The best
word to describe it is stinky, there's just something about these soldiers
that make em smell bad... maybe its their fur.

paths have been created inbetween.  You stand on one of these paths right
now.  In the distance you can hear weapons being sharpened.

Ferahgo's Camp~
	You are in a small circular clearing.  Rocks are everywhere, making
escape impossible, though the way to the east is somewhat clear.  A small
campfire is a blaze here, and a creature sits in the shadows cast by it...
a creature that looks hungary.

Ferahgo's Camp~

sharpening a sword or knife most likely.  Wonder who it could be.

table, cracked and forgotten.  You can just make out the outline of Alpha
Phi Omega on a faded t-shirt in the corner, clearly the owner has not been
able to reclaim this item, you wonder where he might be.  A wave of cold comes
from the door to the north, and you sense a great evil, be prepared.

Shrine of Evil (Crypt of Arcodiac)~
Far below the mortal world, beneath even Hell and the Abyss, the dwelling of
Arcodiac lies entombed, channeling maliciousness via the Lower Planes to the
surface world.  Four pitch black obsidian pillars support the domed roof of
the hall.  A dark altar covered with a dry crimson dust stands at the center
of the Shrine.  It crackles with unholy power and radiates the cold touch of
death.  The souls of previous visitors lament in eternal damnation for daring
to enter the abode of the Ancient Evil.

Shiriff Post of the Lower Shire~
   You are in the shiriff Post which acts as the nucleus for the three shiriffs 
of the Lower Shire.  As you examine the shiriffs on duty, you come to realize
that the halflings of the Shire are not to be reckoned with.  You cower with
awe.  The only exit is to the east.

lightbulb - the home of Yasmin - hovers.
She is what mortals mistake for being the sun - the source of all daylight
below. When inside the beautiful crystal construction, her brilliant radiance
is magnified and channelled downwards in dazzling bright beams, bestowing
light upon her pets.
The inside of the bulb is arranged as a huge nest, padded with several soft
eiderdowns and a host of huge, fluffy pillows, all snowy white. A creamcoloured
silken pyjamas has been carelessly flung over the edge of a pillow.

you are stunned as the picture suddenly changes into a coral reef,
70 feet below the surface!  You stare, mouth agape as the picture
again shifts to a City - but like none you've ever seen before.
Huge buildings reach out to the sky, with two identical towers
dominating the scene.  Curious scents seem to eminate from the
scene, not all of them pleasent.  As the picture shifts to a rain
forest, you look away,awed by the beauty and complexity of the

The picture in your mind continues to get closer until you can see

still and you zoom in on a fido walking by.  You can hear it snarl
at the adventurers at the fountain.  Suddenly, the picture goes
black, and you feel a sense of virtigo.  An angry flea is hopping
around here.  You suddenly realize that you are looking at the back
of a fido who has fleas.  Perhaps you need more practice with this
globe.

possibly power that has been left-over by some divine presence.
There are large pillars of white and black marbe supporting a large dome
shaped roof, upon which are engraved stellar constellations, the pillars
might represent the gods of good and evil. A round circular pool is 
glimmering at the exact center of the hall and as you gaze into its shifting 
waters you can perceive images of people and places far away, possibly in 
other realms, you distinguish a tiny image of yourself, gazing into a gleaming 
pool inside a white hall.

Plains of Xanthe (Domain of Tyae) ~
The plains of Xanthe extend indefinitely up, down, north, and south, glinting
with frozen snow.  Withered grass sticks out in decaying browish clumps.
Thousands of petrified butterflies litter the ground, their colors bleached
nearly white from decades of exposure to the pale, chilly sun.  The cold is
bitter in the day, but ravenous at night, when it invades every crevice and
sucks up vestiges of illusionary warmth.  Six hollow moons are suspended in
the western sky, casting a wane light.  The stretching petals of the Ice
Flowers, which infrequently dot the landscape, capture the phantom illumination
and disperse it in all angles, making the flowers sparkle like slivers of the
moons.

it is the sound of misery, what is the source?  Perhaps you should leave...

off, your eyes slowly get accustomed to your surroundings. Notice the
various implements and devices scattered around the room which he uses with
great delight and ruthlessness to dole out pleasure and pain to his disciples
and victims. Your mind slowly falls into unconsciousness as you start craving
for His touch, His breath on your skin, His puissant blessings. You have
tampered with the Cube and delivered yourself into His hands. And now, you will
experience pleasure through pain, in every concievable way...and then some....
as Hellraiser starts your first lesson in the divine ways of Leviathan. Do
not loose hope, it is but a beginning of a beautiful relationship which will
last eons and uncountable deaths and resurrections. Enjoy friend.

	You are in Something's sitting room.  Clouds form the walls and
furniture, glowing with a pale internal light.  A fireplace with a small
eternal flame is in a corner, and a couch is on the opposite wall.
	Momentos from his time as a mortal fill the room, from the thick
purple rug on the floor, to a painting of a purple penguin done by Picasso.
	A doorway to the south leads back to the mortal realms so that
visitors may freely leave.

The Main Chamber of Ankh.~
  You are standing in a cold stone chamber, the walls surrounding this
lage chamber are covered in hieroglyphics. There ia a magnificent collection
of vases, chariots, thrones, and jewels all about the room, to bad you can't
take a little for yourself. In the corner of the room there is a large stone
sarcophagus belonging to the great Egyption Pharaoh, Tutankhamen, but it
seems that Ankh has claimed this great treasure for himself, it must be where
he sleeps when you are not around. In the center of the room there is a
large altar covered it blood and various other objects involved in an occult
sacrifice, you feel sick at the gory sight of the blood stained altar and
a little relief that you missed the ugly religious rite, or are you the 
next victim for the altar.............

sarcophagus~

The statue looks like a young girl, but the face of it has clearly been
torn away a long time ago. You can see the shards from the statue lying

In the kitchen~
With almost half of the roof collapsed, the kitchen has been reduced to
simple rubble. The forces of nature, winds and rains have decimated almost
everything in here. A broken table lies in the middle of the floor, and pieces
of numerous pots and pans lie everywhere. Through the large cracks in the
walls, you can see the dark trees surrounding the building.

In the main hall~
Standing in the open hall, under a half-collapsed roof, you feel the age

oppressive. High on all the walls you can see some paintings of fighting
scenes. On the northern wall, you see a wooden door, and to the east of you,
a large metal door.

In the hall of swords~
This small chamber is dark and gloomy, and regardless of the decayed state
of the rest of the building, this place seems to be in the exact condition
as it was left on that last day. Only the faint traces in the dust on the
floor give you any idea of visitors since that day. On the walls, you see
several small, metal hooks and holders that obviously were used to store
weapons of many different kinds. No, only the holders remain.

shaped a bit like an arena. Several long benches line the walls, some of them
broken by the blocks of stone that have fallen from the ceiling. You see a
dark doorway leading west, and a wooden door leading south, back to the main
hall.
There is a large metal hatch on the floor.

In the center of the cellar room, there are strong metal ladders coming

On the western wall, there is a burned torch in an old torch holder.

In a dark passage~
In this dark and cold passage, you can immediately smell the same, peculiar
fragrance that you encountered upstairs, only that it is much stronger here
and seems to be coming from ahead. The bare rock walls are smooth and seeping
with ooze-like wetness. Behind you, the secret doorway has swung close
abruptly. There are cobwebs all over, covering even the badly rusted iron
lever on the western end of the passage.
You can feel a strange pull from east, as if something was beckoning you...

pedestal rising from the ooze like an island on high seas. That pedestal seems
to be the source of the pulling force. High above you, the strange winds howl

  Different than the rest this place is fairly well kept...whoever destroyed
the other areas must have been disinterested in this area and so an altar
still stands here and the walls show some interesting scenes from the life
of Cristis the Kind...a ruler of the outlying regions around Midgaard many
years ago...
  The door to the north has been permanently jammed; the southern door seems to
have been ripped out of its hinges so there is nothing but an opening to the
south. The room slopes downward towards the north to a stone door.
The Ghost of Cristis the Kind stands here barely visible to the eye.
You sense he is trying to say something.

  It says an aweful lot for its apperent size:
     "Hello stranger and last hope for Midgaard and this tomb!
   or just anyone who passes through my tomb.  This is a last plea
   for aid by a man long since dead from this Earth.  I have served
   all my life for the cause of good and hope for your help now 
   that my time has passed.  
     The forces of evil have taken control of this tomb and the great
   Kings of old need your aid to free us and deliver us to peace 
   once again. I think that I alone have been able to make myself
   appear and manage to have the last acolyte here write this note,
   for I am unable to speak, or affect this dying world.
     These forces of evil plan to eventually take over Midgaard
   and the outlying reaches for their own! They MUST be stopped. No one
   knows how long this will take it could be days it could be months!
     Their leader goes by the name of Roch'tar, the reincarnated Vampire
   of a time somewhere after my death.  He is yet not able to enter
   this world presently but is somewhere still trapped here in these
   tombs.  You MUST stop him by sytematically destroying his minions
   and followers who he has created from the dead and called from the 
   bowels of the earth!!!
     Thank you all who may endeaver to succeed and and may the Gods
   bless you on your Quest!"

 Two hints: in order to leave this place you must get the special 
    rod from a hidden vault in a room down and to the east somewhere...
    this room will be a painted room as well...look vault and it will
    tell you what to do...the second hint is that I may appear elsewhere
    in the lower sections of the tombs for more help!

the evil creatures that have invaded his domain and grave...He stands here
shimmeringly desolid and quite unable to effect the outside world or be

He holds up a tiny piece of parchment for all to read and look at with a
glimmer of tears in his eyes...

  Beautiful and ancient...scenes of battles with horrid creatures of ugly
distortion...Cristis the Kind and his armies are shown here defeating the
evil armies of the past... You recognize a small painting of an ancient city
as being the older replica of Midgaard...it was much bigger then during the
greater times of the old Empire.

E
altar~
  This king must have been well loved. Great care was taken into the creation
of this altar. It stands only about 2 feet high with the remnants of candle-
wax on its top surface. It says in ancient tongue on its dusty top:
              "Praise the almighty Cristis the bringer of
                 good and justice to the world. He who 
                fought the evilest finally is at peace

Entrance chamber to the great halls of the kings~
  Whomever built this place must have been very rich indeed!  Though
you did enter through a rather small door this place has enough room
to hold a several score of people.  The floor has a beautifully woven
carpet, and the walls are covered in finely crafted tapesties. You can
tell that these things must have been worth much but they have not lasted
well throughtout the ages. Massive doors lead off to the south and a small
door leads up above you only accessable via. a large stone staircase.

  The tapesties were woven into beautiful and exciting scenes of battles
long ago. One on the left your shows the historic battle between Jubal the
Benevolent and Hroth Kragen's forces that eventually Jubal's army won (of
course) and was responsible for the forming the city within which you now
reside.  Here was the most inportant stategic point in Jubal's supply-line
due to the how remote it is and of course it was (at that time) the last
major population and mercanile district before the sea...where of course
Hroth's forces were eventually driven and demolished.

who saved the northern regions from being overrun by the Goblin hordes of
100 years ago. If not for him Midgaard of course would have eventually been
squashed by these monsters as well...luckily this was not the case. Tho it
is now appearent that a new threat has appeared to the city and this region.
Though Crotus was a goodly king, it was rumored that he turned to the dark ways
in his dying years...supposed he died an evil man...

Mitnar. Scenes show get heaps of treasure and weapons sacrificed to the 
Great Mitnar. Even today there exist cult worshipers of this long dead
great warrior and king. Where his coffin was...there is now only a 
rectangular blemish on the floor of the dusty room...hmm...there is something
odd about the floor tho...the western wall has a hole punched through it as

The lower chambers and tombs of the undead~
  The stench of death is heavy in here...you think you may get easily lost
in these caverns...But then again this place is quite different!
  The room has been totally hollowed out and smoothed...and a pit has
been drilled in the center of the floor (though nothing is in it).
  Also extensive gruesome paintings of beasts and monsters terrorizing the
country side; vampires sucking the blood of beasts and humans alike...
the scenes are horribly graphic.
The Ghost of Cristis is floating here...

parchment~
  Written on it he says :
      "Congratuations adventurer you made it this far! Now, in order
    to get out of here look at the vault hidden in the painting and
    get the key pry rod that will take you out...if you have passed
    through all of these monsters and abonimations with ease you are
    ready to continue. But if not the rod will help you get out.The
    Vault will clue you on what to open.
      There exists nearby a horrid beast called Snapper Joe...he is
    a reincarnated fiend called up directly from hell...he is tough
    but if you manage to kill him he has a key to the lower depths 
    of these horrid tombs and catacombs. I cant promise you what lies
    ahead but it will promise to be challenging and hopefully will
    prove that we are nearing the end of the reign of the Horrid
    Roch'tar.
      If you need to rest and come back, take the rod. But remember to 
    dump it so that others will have a chance at continuing here also.
      Thank you again brave fellows!"

Evidently the Butcher does some business to some non-humans in this realm,
because you see several butchered human corpses hanging from the ceiling.
This room must have been hidden so that the cityguards never find out about
his little side business here.  Hmm...there's also some other kinds of meats
laying around here, Beastly Fido meat, gremlin meat, and halfling meat are
the most common.  You kinda wish you had never found this room, because now

City Entrance~
   You stand on the outskirts of a large city - Midgaard; the capital of this
land. The road leads east into the peace and quiet - and dangers - of the
forest; and to the west it becomes the main street of the town; surrounded by
a confusion of shops, bars, and market places. To the south is a very high tower,
The Death Tower.

        You see a lot cooking utensils here. The pots and pans are all

	A sudden rustle of leaves makes you spin around in a strangely jerking
manner, as you attempt peering into the shadows. NO apparent enemy is in sight
...but neither would a tapdancing moose be, as the veil of darkness conceals
mostly anything further than a few inches away from your nose.

your being. Looking down the vaulted chamber you see a huge sarcophagus
bearing the likeness of Akinra. Statues of kneeling worshipers face his
tomb. You notice the bones of some daring adventurers, less fortunate 
than you hope to be. One still grasps an ink pen in his right hand.

          1    3    2    4
          N    W    N    S

This isn't too tough, so don't take it so rough.

Mining equipment room~
This is the storage room for equipment used by the
Dwarven miners.  It is very small, and you can tell that
not many miners actually use any equipment.

Solved the Maze.~
You have solved the maze.  You can tell by the last few moves
that there is no way that a dumb worker could have figured that
out.  It seems pretty desolate here.  To the south is a bleak room.
To the north, you see the maze.  There is a sign above the south exit:

THOSE WHO ENTER, PLAN ON A TIMELY DEATH.
(ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE LOYAL TO THE QUEEN)

Muerte's Throne~
  You see about you the remains of the victims of `bMuerte`h.  Some appear to
have been human, and some were definately not.  The skeletons and skulls all 
seem to glimmer brightly in the eerie light radiated by the dominant object in
the room, `bMuerte`h's Throne.  It is constructed from the skeletons and skins
of his victims, and seems to scream with pain even now.  You shiver and wonder
who will be the next victim of `bMuerte`h.

Lost in the woods.~
  You enter what appears to be a small clearing, when the howls of wolves 
surround you.  You run frantically, but to no avail... You are now lost in the
woods, and you only choice is to wait for the wolves to close in and end your
suffering.  Have a nice day.~

Burning in the flames~
  You have wandered too close to the edge of the catwalk, and have fallen into
the fiery furnace that heats the ancient castle of Paranor.  You should have 
heeded the warnings of the signs, and avoided walking too close to the edge, 
because not even the strongest protection from fire spell could save you now.

  Please do not try to attract the attention of any
      adventurers in the forest, as you are not
         really in existence at the moment.

an outpost that ws overrun by evil creatures, but can not recall the details.
Some old rusted and ruined weapons and armor are scattered along the trail

In a sheltered corner~
You are in a sheltered corner made by the cliffs north and west face, a huge
pile of rubble to the east. The ash here has been blown up against the cliff
base.  Here and there in the ash you see small glints of metal, on closer
examination you realise they are fragments of sword and armour.
You stand beside a huge cliff which has melted under a titanic onslaught,
there are HUGE craters in the cliff made by something.  Large chunks of rock
from the cliff lie around here, all are glassy in appearance.

PIN BOARD~
		 IDEAS FOR EXPANSIONS TO THIS AREA.

I have many planned expansions to this area, all link in to this area, all
of the descs give many hints to `things afar in the distance'.

1:      The crater/basin.   (around **49 room)
	Maze extrodinare... this time a true random maze done with a generator
on boot up time.  Put lots of nasties in there, aggr, dual, fury, invuln etc.
nastier the better 'cos of all the goodies in the ramp ;) .
 
2:      The ramp.   (throught the basin area preferably)
	What the gods fought over. The buildings on there could be sort of
embasies to various gods or guilds representing gods.  The top broken off
because the gods did it (foul tempers etc).  I think this would be a good
high level area, groups espicially.  I thought about having rooms which only
certain classes could enter etc, nice objs in them.  Make it a no reloc area,
make it _hard_ for the mortals. *cackle*

3:      Area of darkness.   (northish from **72 area)
	This could be like another zyca (underground part) or the pirate area
usually put just of the graveyard.  Basically one really nice item at the end
of a series of increasingly nasty set of mobs.

4:      The village.
	A complete rewrite/aditions??  The village is very underdeveloped, it
could do with about 3 times as many rooms and different mobs.

5:      General expansion direction.
	Room 4006 (or what ever it is called now **06) is there for general
expansion, it is desert/skrub land but is open to all sorts of wierd and 
wonderfull ideas.


Of course there are more ideas from me but i will leave them up to you who 
are reading this ;)  The ideas here are not cast in concrete but are here 
for guidance, the area theme has set them up for use, i just might not be 
here to finish them, this one took long enough *chuckle*.

All for now,
	    Tedric THE Oreo Pirate.

P.S If you want me i may still be at this address r.j.hodkinson@bradford.ac.uk

P.P.S  Happy mudding all.  Cul8r.

You look around quickly behind you to see if anyone has noticed your passage,

Every where you look the landscape is a soft ash which seems to be shifting
ever so slightly around you. The mist hides all features on the horizon
except for a vague roughening of the land to the east and north.

By the mountain of debris~
You are hemmed in on the north and south sides by the mountain of junk
To the north and east lies an impenetrable mess of bodies with a sprinkling of
rocks.  Amongst the mess you see huge white and black bones of impossible
size, as you glance round you notice that every weapon has been shattered to
pieces.  To the south and west the mess of debris eases as the ever present
covers it.

Ash ridden landscape~
Your foot steps crunch on the soft ash here.
You look around quickly behind you to see if anyone has noticed your passage,
you notice your foot prints have disappeared, you notice small pieces of bone
and armour in the ash around you.
Every where you look the landscape is a soft ash which seems to be shifting
ever so slightly around you. The mist hides all from view except a looming
mound of something to the north east.

Inside a smell shack.~
You enter the evil smelling shack.  Inside you are surprised by the neatness
of the interior, someone has made an effort to disguise the ramshackle affair
of the shack.  On the floor is a very battered but strangely clean rug.  The
tables and chairs seem to be in usable condition, on the hearth is a bubbling
pot of food.  You hear a quiet shuffling of feet outside......

The hidden room.~
The pit hides a dark secret.  Formless shapes hovers in a corner of the pit.
You cannot make out its shape as it shifts so fast, as you look closer you see
that is moves in and out of the walls with ease, you then notice other
formless shapes appearing and disappearing from the walls.  You become very
uneasy as one makes a move in your direction.

heaps of sleeping rugs, all in a disgusting state, the smell here is even

on the floor, as you listen you can hear the ever present rats skittering
around the walls.  As you scuff the floor with your feet you kick up clouds of
choking dust.  There is nothing in here to take your interest.  You begin to

cloud you can hear the faint sounds of Midgaard. Right before you to the
north lies the grand Mansion of Naris, the residence of the Greater God
Redferne.

The Southern end of the hall~
You are standing in a vast hall that is dimly lit, but wherefrom the
light comes, is a mystery. The walls seem to radiate warmth and give
the pleasent feeling of being welcome here. A large portrait is hanging
on one of the walls. A large wooden staircase leads up into the tower.
To the east there is a high passage away from the hall. This ends
shortly after by a tall oak door. The enormous hall extends further
north from here. To the south you can see a huge, and VERY heavy-
looking iron-wrought door. It looks like this is the only exit from
this magnificent old house. To the west you can see a large ashen door.

Redferne's Library~
This is truly a magnificent place! Books and scrolls lie together on every
shelf. A large globe, with the map of the Mud-world upon it, stands in the
dimly lit north-western corner of the room. Two large and comfortable-
looking leather arm-chairs adourn the center of the library together with
a huge oak desk. Dim light radiates from an enormous crystal chandelier
hanging down from the ceiling approximately 10 feet off the floor. To the
east there is a great old ashen door. A large glass window is set in the
west wall.

To the south lies the Southern end of the hall. To the east there is a huge

As you descend, the chain seems to absorbe all weather around it, making it
swing less and less in the very powerful wind tearing at it. The Chain seems
to chuckle quietly, and as you descend further you hear a soft whisper
originating from within the Chain *ITSELF*. 
It says, " Welcome back some other time, stranger. Your company is always
           ... hmmm ... interesting. God Speed. "
The chain extends further down through the now spreading clouds.

The Great Hall~
   You are standing in the southern end of the Great Hall. It 
is truly vast; the roof is so high above your head, that it seems no
closer than the clouds outside. The roof is beautifully painted, by
someone who must have been a true master. The hall is very large,
and could easily seat several hundred people at a banquet. To your
north, you see King Welmar's great throne, and to the south is the
Castle Entrance.

the animal that died to yield a piece of that size. The Hall continues

guarding. The windows are slits for bowmen, very narrow on the 
outward side and broad inwards to allow a wide shooting angle.
The only evident exit is down the stairs again.

The Top of the Tower~
   This is the highest of all the towers, and is obviously used for lookout purposes. The view is splendid in all four directions. All around you, the rich countryside spreads out to the horizon. To the north and east you see a vast mountain range, and far to the west a beautiful lake. A bit closer, the town of Midgaard lies at the end of the King's Road. The only exit you can see is down again.

Office~
You find youself in a lavish office.  The desk is absolutely huge,
at least ten feet by five feet and made of ebony and inlaid with
mother of pearl.  A grandfather clock towers over the room,
mechanically ticking and tocking the hours away.

Eastern tower.~
You are in the bottom part of a tower.  A draft brings a chill to
your spine and causes creaks and groans.  Curtains flutter in the
wind, causing quite a distraction.  When you go to shut the window,
you see that the window is closed.  An old, wooden staircase leads
up into darkness.

Eastern tower.~
The tower creaks and groans, almost as if it were muttering to
itself.  There are windows displaying a full moon, reigning over
the night sky.  The room is dark and there is almost a musty odor
to it.  You are surprised that you can't detect any dust or dirt,
although there are a couple of cobwebs in the corner.

Mid-Air.~
You slide down the moisture covered rock, gaining speed as you
approach the cliff.  Realizing your foolish error, you madly claw
at the rock, vainly trying to get a precious hold and save your
worthless hide.  Next time, heed your conscience.

Entrance to the lost city of Loftwick~
This is the entrance to the lost city of Loftwick.  The once beautiful 
architecture has long since been destroyed.  Parts of the ceiling here
has caved in and rubble lines the streets.  There appears to be footprints
in the dust on the ground here.  Fresh ones......

Library of Loftwick~
There are literally hundreds of books lying here. They are surprisingly
in good condition. After a brief search of the texts you learn that
Loftwick was not only the founder of this city but was also the brother
of Redferne the Grand Knight of Paladins. Loftwick left Midgaard after
a bitter dispute with Redferne. He used vile magics in pursuit of
immortality. Through his magics he met a race called the GITHYANKI that 
offered to help him in exchange for a haven on this plane that they 
could raid Midgaard from. Loftwick agreed but he didn't count on the 
Githyanki turning his city into a realm of the living dead and a truly 
EVIL place.

in only moments ago.  You sense a great anger as it becomes apparent 
that for Karn to grant Loftwicks request, Loftwick had to murder his own wife
to show dedication to Karn.

You stand in an immense hall. There are long faded murals painted here of

A Dining Hall~
You stand now in a large room with a long table in the center. Many 
skeletons lie slumped on the table as if they had been poisoned sitting at 
the table. You can almost hear the laughter of the ones who were

Vista~
	This is a stunning vista overlooking a canyon.  There is a sign
here that says : "BEHOLD -- ELEMENTAL CANYON".
	Fire leaps up from firepits in the western part of the canyon.
The sky looks funny, and the air seems hazy to the northwest.  Elec-
tricity sparks intermitantly in the northeast.  To the east you see a
strong, magic-looking river flowing through the canyon.  Also to the
east you spy a cave enterence leading into the canyon wall.  The path
descends to the north to anoher overlook.
Out of the corner of your eye you notice a hint. . .

The Burning Gardens~
	Everywhere around you the landscape is afire; the rocks, the
shrubs and even the air seems to be aflame.  Curiously, the magical
fire does not seem to consume its hosts.  The gardens continue north,
south, and west.  A path leads east among some fire pits.

small hillock, is an all to unfamiliar tree. Radial lines of
grass feed out from the tree and you feel a sense of power
radiating from it. Exits lie north and south along a
cobblestone street and east and west lead into buildings.

               BOLD ADVENTURERS!!

   Recently, it seems that some nasty little monsters made a hole in our wall
dowstairs in the Cellar. We soundly trashed them and none of them have enough
courage to enter the Cellar again, however, the Monastary would appreciate it
if you would help us keep their numbers down and fear in their hearts.
   Though the Monastary could easily purge the menace, we just don't feel like
taking the time away from our prayers and training to do this. Any assistance
you provide would be appreciated and you may keep anything you find down
there as a reward for your help.

   You can hardly believe the amount of green fungi growing on the walls
in this largish chamber. Not only is the fungi abundant, it also gives off a

you suddenly think, "What if there is something down there that is MUCH
tougher than the things that are up here?  What if the things up here are
actually trying to get away from something down there?"
   You suddenly remember that you were supposed to be somewhere (well, 
anywhere besides here would do nicely) and decide to go back.

forest of rabbits behind.  Ahead you sense the presence of malicious and cruel

nausea at the sight of the dead bodies of inserts and small animals,

The Queen Chamber~
   It is a very luxury chamber. All furnitures here were made by the best
carpenter. Although they were made of wood, they were much expensive than
the golden furnitures. The floor here is covered with the most expensive
carpet. The only exit is to the west.

The King Chamber~
   It is a very very luxury chamber. It has a very beautiful fountain in
the room and the fountain is filled with the best wine. The bed here is
bigger than a big dinner table. The floor here is covered with the most
expensive carpet. The only exit is to the west.

  The room you now find yourself in was, in better times, the
recreational center of the castle.  But unfortunately for you, it
hasn't been used or even visited for many, many years.  This is
proven, as you hear a large *CRACK*, and the beams supporting the
ceiling (and tons of dirt) splinter and the whole load comes crashing
down on you.  You see a faint white light.  In the light you see your
one and only, whom you left back on the surface.  In the light you see
your friends, tears in their eyes.  In the light you see a mother,
dressed in black, weeping.  In the light you see a half eaten
banana...  "An odd thing to see at this point" you think as your last
breath escapes from your lungs and the world fades to black.

  This is a small entrance to a set of newly constructed rooms to the
south.  Though small, the room is dazzlingly decorated.  The walls are
solid gold, and the floor is covered by a huge persian rug.  Large
silver torch sockets line the walls, and the scene of some ancent
fable is painted on the ceiling.

New Laboratory~
  You are what appears to be a newly constructed laboratory, a quite
large laboratory.  Strange looking weapons and armor lie strewn about
among horrid-looking body parts.  Large flasks filled with oddly
colored liquids litter the place, as well.

Ancient Tunnel~
  This is an ancient tunnel many miles below the town of Midgaard.
The tunnels were carved centuries ago, perhaps by dwarves enslaved by
a cruel taskmaster.  They are crumbling and smell old and musty.  A
newer smell, howerever, overrides that old smell--the smell of a foul,
barbaric creature.

Path Through the Graveyard~
The muffled odor of decayed flesh reaches your nostrils as you walk through the
home of long forgotten heroes and nobles. Despite the holy nature of this
place, you feel a chill as you step between the crumbled gravestones. These
dead men may once have been good people, but you can sense evil magic at work.
Shadows seem to appear of their own accord in the mist that prevails here, and
you hear occaisonal rustling sounds from all around you. Vague shapes flit
about on the edge of your vision, but when you look there is nothing there.

that this room must have been sealed for centuries before now. You suddenly
feel very calm after your walk through the graveyard, as if the evil presence
haunting the area had not yet managed to breach the walls of this holy place.
As you pass through, you try not to disturb even the dust covering every
surface, for fear of disturbing those who rest here. The floor appears to be
marked with strange runes, which have somehow remained free of dirt and dust.
Something is written on the wall next to you.

You are in a non-descript room with exits to the north, east, south, and west.
There is a strange feeling about the place, remeniscent of the calm before a
storm. There appear to be runes on the floor here, though what they mean you
have no idea. In amongst these odd engravings, you notice the faint outline of
a trap door in the floor.

runes~
The runes are engraved into the stone floor of the room. Under this close
inspection, you can make out something of what they mean. You get the idea that
they are warning you of something ahead....

Blazing Inferno~
The heat here will surely kill you if you stay much longer! Your skin is 
charring before your eyes, and your armor seems to be welding itself onto your
skin. The stone walls are glowing, and you doubt your eyes will hold up much
longer either. There appears to be some sort of magical gate to the north.

Relief spreads over your limbs as you step through the gate. You are in the
elemental plane of fire, and though everything around you is burning 
violently you feel none of it. The gate remains behind you, and you can see
the room you left through it like a painting on a wall.

Raging Hurricane~
You no longer make any effort to keep your feet on the ground; it is obvious
as you are smashed violently off the wall that this would do you no good. 
The wind is so strong here it is surprising the whole place doesn't blow over, 
and you can see other things that have been caught here suffering the same fate
as you. To the east, you can see some sort of magical gate.

After fumbling your way through the magical gate, you are rewarded with instant
relief from the constant beating off of the walls and other object you suffered
in the hurricane. You are standing on a fluffy white cloud, and can see others
like it all around you. Birds chirp merrily in the distance.

Rock Cavern~
You are in a cavern out of rock, seemlingly through nothing but the force of
nature. Moss grows on the walls, and there is some sort of slimy algae on the
wet floor. You can hear watter dripping periodically in the distance, and
strange animal noises echo around. A distant roar reaches your ears.

Behind the Falls~
Sheets of water fall before your eyes. You can vaguely see outdoors through
the torrents of frothing water. Sunlight catches the spray, making little
rainbows play about all around you. The river flowing along the floor joins
this greater body of water, plummeting to the pool beneath. The rock floor
of the cavern extends out further to the north, through the waterfall.

The Stone Bridge~
As you walk along this narrow stretch of rock, you try to keep from thinking
about what would happen if you fell off. All around you all you can see is
falling water. The natural phenomenon here seems to be a large depression
in a massive lake, with some sort of underground passages absorbing all the
water or sending it somewhere else. A huge circular waterfall rages 
everywhere, and the roar is deafening. The bridge you are walking across must
be held in place magically, for it extends over several hundred feet and yet
is only a few feet in width and depth. Something is engraved on the ground.

At this point, the prime material plane meets all the elemental planes. You

The Temple of Light~
Here worshippers come to pay homage to Vishnu, god of mercy and light. On the
walls you see painted symbols of the sun-disc, seashell, lotus and mace.
Maruts guard the temple and aid worshippers in need. A small altar is in one
end, and monks sit around it meditating. A peaceful humming sound seems
to come from the walls themselves, and you realize that you are hearing the
sound of Vishnu's followers seeking enlightenment.

the Mallorntrees are covered by a smooth silver-white bark. The leaves are
palegreen on top and silver underneath, it almost looks like some maniac has
come up with some brilliant idea to paint all leaves in the forest with silver
paint. A path leads eastwards and the river is to the west.

The Woodsmen's Glade~

plant. This is the guildplace of the woodsmen, the keepers of the forest. The
woodsmen handles the maintenance of Loriens gardens, vineyard, fields and
paths. The path leads from east to west. To the west you see a great

  The Riverbank lies high above the river. River makes a turn south in here and
disappears into large waterfall. Suddenly the river seems to have more power 
than it had few minutes ago. Water raises in the river and part of the 
riverbank drops into water. The Riverbank seems now too steep to climb back up
and you decide to move away to east from the roaming River. 
You notice though that strange sound that comes when you walk on the muddy 
riverbank. Seems like there must be a hole under your feet.

You are hanging on a rope above the bottomless pit.  There are many of these 
ropes hanging from the ceiling into the pit, and also poles stuck in the walls 
to climb up and down.  But be very careful, for only the most nimble will
survive here, and the rest will fall to an endless death.  The wind howling in
the pit makes your head spin.  Getting to either side of the pit without
falling forever will be quite a challenge.

mist~
The white mist fills the whole chamber, limiting the vision almost to nothing.
The mist seems to irritates your eyes, and makes them watery. You see some
vague shape in the mist, maybe a statue of some kind.
~
E
statue~
The statue resembles a bald man wearing a violently fluttering robe. He
stands in an alert position. While examining the statue, you notice a small
hatch on the floor beside the statue's podium. It's made of pure silver.

The Forgotten Chamber~
You are standing in a room that has been out of use for an eternity, or at
least appears to be so. A thick layer of dust and spider webs cover the floor
and the walls. A large murky looking pedestal stands in the middle of the room.
The ominous silence of this chamber makes you feel uneasy. Narrow stone stairs
come down from a hatch in the ceiling.
There is a piles of bones in the far corner.

The Entrance Hall~
You are standing in a huge hall with floor made of marble plates of
considerable size. Only the silence and the age of this place are
noticeable. Not a sign of life can be seen anywhere. Wide passages

The Way of The Brave, by the Bottomless Pit~
You are standing in the southern edge of a dark and bottomless pit. Thick wooden
poles and cotton ropes are hanging in the pit, leading down to the depths.
You would have to climb across the pit by way of the ropes and poles.
It would take a very nimble, lucky, or courageous person to make it across the
pit without falling into its endless darkness.  Wide passages lead both east
and west from the pit, winding southwards quickly.  On the other side of the  
pit, you can barely make out a passage leading northward..

This tunnel is slick, you have to concentrate to keep upright.  WHOOPS!
You fall down.  Heh Heh, what was that? Is some power playing with you? There
are exits to the north and to the south.  To the north is the dead spider
tunnel, and to the south is a glowing door.

The Portal~
The tunnel leads out into a huge cavern.  In the far southern wall is a door.
It is glowing and a mist is swirling around inside of it.  You first seem to
think it's a moongate, but why are there guards here?  Why are they looking
at you and the portal funny?  The commander tells you, "Don't enter the
Portal, none have returned.  Do as you wish, but we won't stop you."

They'd rather kill you and torture you then befriend you.  These elves are
Drow, and they should be feared by all.  There is a saying, "The only good
Drow, are dead Drow."  You see that this room is very elegant.  The room
has hues of purple, obsidan, blood red, violet, and amber.  The furnisings
would be considered luxury by kings and queens.  The room has a set of double
doors on the east side of the chamber.  The only other exit is through the

Greenhouse~
It's very humid and warm. You can see many exotic species of plants, there is
always a sign next to the plant which tells you the name of it. As you look
up you notice that the roof is made out of glass and you can see the sky
through it. There is a huge Venus's-flytrap growing in the corner of the room,
you think that this plant might even eat little bit larger meals than just
flies.

	Saturday, 7th of the November

Everything seems to be ready for the opening.

	Monday, 9th of the November

7 days till the opening. It seems that someone is trying to disturb us... 
Some exhibits have been dropped on to the floor etc. I hope we manage to 
catch the rogue.

	Thursday, 12th of the November

Teasing that I mentioned earlier has continued... We've also heard weird
howls etc. I hope we are just over excited about the opening.

	Friday, 13th of the November

I'm very scared... I ran away to my office because some of our exhibits
have turned alive. Most of my employees have been killed... Evil has 
invaded this museum, I hope someone will save us........
