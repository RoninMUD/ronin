 A melange of strange markings covers the external surface of the
castiron behemoth. Several disturbingly distinct images of a gallows,
guillotine and rack require no translation; nor do the deep claw marks
stretching almost a cubit in length. Several runes glow a brilliant
azure and the jet-black surface of the pot seems to ripple and pulse.
 Inside the pot a strange cloudy pseudo-liquid disperses and reforms
transforming to and from gas unpredictably.
