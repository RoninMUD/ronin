corpse cityguard~
What bits of clothing and armor that remain on the cityguard's
corpse show that he was from Midgaard.  At this point it is
impossible to know whether he was here as a spy or captured
by the evil forces.  It's clear that he was brutally tortured,
but it leaves the question: how much did he tell his captors?
