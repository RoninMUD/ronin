key~
The key appears fairly old, and old and fresh
stains from bloodspatter remains on its rusted
alloy. The blood glistens in the dim light from
your torch.

The handle of the key is quite flat, and you
can barely make out the letters engraved into it:
"THE MORTUARY".

piles dead children~
Chopped up little bodies, stacked up in piles,
their putrid stench, can be smelled from miles.
Young boys and girls, once living playful lives,
their short lives ended, by the Butcher's knives.
Decapitated heads, dead staring blue eyes,
the sweet sweet fresh meat, clawed out by mice.
A severed pale hand, drenched in fresh blood,
lies lifeless in a corner, resting in mud.
