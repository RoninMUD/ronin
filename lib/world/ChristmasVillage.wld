Before the Gates of the North Pole~
   Cold air drives snowflakes through the air like tiny daggers,
each flurry cutting through the air like a barrage of blades, each
slicing a little deeper then the last. Two massive gates, made of 
ancient ironwood rise up to the north. Intricate carvings and patterns
cover both gates, while an almost other worldly glow eminates from
deep inside the wood. Massive walls loom to the east and west, cold
dark stone a stark contrast to the warmth of the gates. Icicles hang
like massive daggers from the edges, threatening to break and fall with
every gust of wind. Massive drifts of snow have piled up against the
foot of the walls and gate, while little rivers of red spill down their
face.Tiny elf heads, mouths grinning crazily, pointed ears streaked
with blood, are lined up in a neat row on top of the drifts, no evidence
of bodies or weapons their eyes seem unnaturally focused despite
decapitation.

Santa Drive~
   The snow drifts lining the street are stained with
blood and ash. Chunks of burned and smoking flesh lay
in piles smelling slightly of roast chicken and sage.
The crackle of flames and the distant scream as the 
elves find another helpless soul hiding in vain, fill
the crisp cold evening with an invigorating air.
   To the east the side of the building has collapsed
inwards exposing an elfin bar, to the west the door
is cracked open while a soft giggle floats into the
air every few seconds. North and South the road continues
amidst the debris.

An Elfs dwelling~
   There is a metallic tang to the air, its the harsh scent of
blood and feces. Crusted blood forms patterns and swirls on the
walls, at least the ones still standing. The stairs at the back
of the room have collapsed in a pile of rubble, broken boards
blunted under the mattresses that have fallen from the upper
floor. A hand twitches under a cupboard that has fallen over
while the remains of a reindeer hang from the ceiling dripping
blood from a half hearted attempt to skin it. A small record
player plays christmas carols in the corner.

The Empty Pint~
   The shards and fragments of pint glasses and earthenware jugs have
been scattered around the wreckage of the tables and chairs. Flames
smolder under the wreckage of the bar, the wood saturated with blood,
not fully igniting. The half naked body of an elf lies in the center of
the room, a pint glass embedded firmly in his forhead, one hand twitching
faintly as if the body is still trying to remove the deadly glass. A cask
behind the bar lies in ruins, a pair of legs draped over the shattered
bung, while from the tap blood drips into an ever expanding pool on the
floor. A table in the corner features three madly grinning elf heads on
a serving tray, while their bodies have been propped upright in the seats
nearby.

Santa Drive~
   Splintered wood and masonry have been driven through
the corpses of a few reindeer foolish enough to wander 
across the path of maurading elves. Christmas lights have
strung up the corpses of a few of Santa's personal body
guard. The amount of destruction wrought upon the nearby
buildings seem to indicate a large amount of explosive
has been detonated nearby.
   To the east the roadway heads off towards the snow
drifts, flickering flames seem to indicate the stables
are on fire. North and South the road seems to continue
amid the debris.

The Yearly Fruitcake~
   A stale fruitcake is embedded in the middle of an elf, nearly severing
his torso from his hips. The legs of a reindeer are burning merrily in
the fireplace while the trunk of the beast has been hollowed out to create
a bench. The soft, ruined corpse of another elf lies tossed in a corner
where someone or something left him after using his body to reduce the 
furniture in the room to kindling. Food and drink have been flung all over
the floor and walls, smears and streaks of intestine and blood mixing with
pudding and pasta to form a cocktail of refuse producing a horrible odor.
The stone work over the door to the kitchen has collapsed, causing the
second story to sag low, freezing air swirling in amongst the cracks in
the walls.

   Tiny hoofprints in the snow have filled with blood, now long frozen over.
The air is very still, snow flakes falling straight down, uninterrupted by
even the faintest whisper of a breeze. Wisps of straw lay strewn about the
frozen street, some dyed red with blood, others matted solid with urine and
snow. Stars glisten over head, sharp and clear between the rooftops, casting
light in the darker corners of the street.

Stable Lane~
   The head of a reindeer lies severed deep in a snow drift, the corpse
seperated into pieces, legs stacked neatly against the wall, skin removed
and folded into a neat square, meat frozen in the snow. Numerous steel
jawed bear traps have been covered in a light dusting of snow, the severed
legs of several elfs stuck in the midst of the sprung traps, torsos nowhere
to be seen. 
   To the north the ruins of the flight control tower rise up into the air,
the top having erupted into the cold air. To the east the stables loom up
across Buildit row, embers smoldering in the thatched roof.

Flight Operations Center~
   Brick and mortar have collapsed in a heap, blocking all access to
the curved stairway up. High above the floor has caved in, a mass of 
electrical and control wires barely holding the ruins together. Cold
air swirls through the shattered windows, fanning the flames of small
electrical fires flickering dimly under overturned communcations
equipment. The remains of an elf hang down limply between the floor
joists, one arm tangled in the wiring, another yanked out by the shoulder
appears stuck in a paper shredder. Damp, warm blood drips down onto the
rubble below.

Stable Lane and Buildit Row~
   Cobblestones peek through the frozen layer in places, as the wind has pushed
most of the snow into the corners of the square. Shattered glass and bricks lay
strewn about the north west side where it appears something large collided with
the side of the flight control tower. A long red smear of blood, along with chunks
of flesh and tufts of skin mark the descent of a once living creature along the
side of the tower. Parallel marks on the ground leave bloody smears across the
corpse of an elf, streaking read lines off to the west.
   To the west the doors to the stable hang off their hinges, smoke leaking out
and rising up into the night air. Under the thatched roof, the glowing embers
of a smoldering fire can be seen just waiting to burst into flame. To the north
and south Buildit row continues.

The Stables~
   Packed dirt clearly shows the imprints of hundreds of tiny hooves leading to
and from the entrance to the stables. A bloody smear in the ground indicates a
heavy, leaking, animal or elf being dragged behind the sleigh or reindeer. 
Stalls line one wall, many standing open and empty, a few giving off an aroma
that indicates it being occupied by some form of decomposing object. Feces and
straw are piled high all around the room, no one in sight to clean up behind
the reindeer. One tiny elf, impaled on the tines of a pitchfork, looks to be
the victim of a horrible accident. 
   To the south a door stands open to the sleigh storage room, the christmas
sleigh stands ready, its back filled with presents.

The streetlamps are cold and dark, movement flickers in the shadow shrouded
corners, shapes not quite discernable in the darkness. A cloud of thick smoke
swirls against the end of the street, blowing down from the roof of the stables.
   To the east the sleigh storage warehouse stands, no noises coming from
within while to the west the small, dilapadated hut of an elf stands wide open.

   Mold has begun growing in the corners of the roof, damp and cold creeping in
between every crack and crevice. The fireplace seems to have vomited soot and
ash all over the floor, the rotting and decayed corpse of an elf having been
tossed into the cold hearth. The dark patina of rotting wood covers the floor
and chairs, blood and ice have mixed to form dark stains in the corners of the
room. The smell of decayed flesh and fungus mix a nauseating scent that fills
the room.

Sleigh Storage~
   Santa's christmas sleigh stands in the middle of the wide open hangar. A red
streak leading from the stables underneath one of the sleigh runners, ends at
the corpse of an unfortunate elf that appears to have been impaled during the
last flight. Most of his side and back have been left in the street and stables
during the last few minutes of travel, his wide eyes staring at nothing. An
enormous door faces south, a clearly marked runway strip leading straight to it.
A small box is mounted next to the door, a key hanging inside, a small red and
white lable clearly affixed to the front. Two stacks of presents are piled along
one wall, One seems ready for immediate loading into the sleigh, the other sags
and tilts as the soggy bottoms of each package appears to be leaking blood.
   To the west the door is open to the street, while to the north the sight and
smell of the stables is very clear. The massive landing and take off doors are
closed and locked to the south.

   Snow and mud have been mixed into a brown slush by the passing of countless
tiny feet. Some footprints have clear outlines but most just blend into the 
brown mess on the ground. Two elves, frozen solid up to the armpits in a mass
of their own congealed blood, have been set as if to guard the bottom of a set
of ice covered stairs. The stairs, slick with red ice lead up to the entrance 
of the workshop. The dome high above caving in under the weight of several dead
reindeer that appear to have plummted to their deaths.
   To the west a small shed stands open, a small red rivulet flowing out into
the slush filled street. To the south the road continues past the smoldering
stables into the quiet cold night.

Workshop Tool Storage~
   A pool of blood grows ever larger in one end of the shed. Tiny rivers
of blood trickle through the dirt coming from the mound of reindeer corpses
stacked in the center of the room. Lines of tiny holes in the sides and heads
of these animals seem to indicate they were bludgeoned to death with the rake
lying on the ground, pointed tines rising upwards. Tools of all sorts line the
walls, on one side replacement tools for toy makers are stacked in bins, drills
hammers, tiny saws and sanders everything the workshop might need. On the other
side tools for the general maintenance of the north pole are hung on the wall.
Rakes and shovels, wheelbarrows and other things have their own individual pegs.

   High snowbanks have drifted up against the eastern
buildings, seemingly blocking all the entrances. A
trickle of red flows down the mound of snow filling a 
hole in the snow with a shining pool of blood. The head
of Rudolph floats serenly in the middle of the pool, 
strangely missing his signature nose. In place someone 
has stuck a carrot in a cruel parody of a snowman. 
   From the east the ruins of the North Pole print shop lie
exposed to the snow, a flickering light coming from the
print room and a faint clanking sound give evidence that
its not completely abandoned. To the west a small hut that
is home to an elf teeters on exposed posts, as if the wind
could blow it right over. To the north and south the
road continues amongst the debris.

   A solitary printing press clanks away in the middle of the room,
the printed documents falling loosely to the floor in a pile of red
inked leaflets. There doesn't appear to be any text, just the outline
of a tiny head. The half shredded corpse of an elf is hanging over
the edge of the printing mechanism twitching every time the plates
clang closed. The haunches of a reindeer are stuck in the spokes
of a chandelier hanging from the ceiling, while the other half of
the corpse seems to have left a streak of gore across the floor.
Cold air swirls soft flakes of snow in through a hole in the roof
caused by the reindeers abrupt departure from this world.

night. Stairs lead up along the far wall, bannister decorated with

of horribly butchered elves, while small drifts have formed
against various limbs and chunks of frozen meat. Only the 
pointy ears give away the fact that once these were breating
creatures of the north.
   Flickering lights and the sounds of sawing come from inside
the ruins of the hospital to the north. Workshop boulevard
seems to continue to the east and west, weaving amongst the
ruins of various buildings scattered limbs of various elves.

intact torsos. A frozen layer of blood coats the snow, large
bootprints clearly defined by the white snow peeking through
the bloody crust. Drifting through the cold air comes the
faint meaty sound of flesh encountering something solid.
   To the north a large building looks to be a normal sized
dwelling, a well decorated house except for the smears of
blood along the walls and shattered glass. The head of an
Elf appears to be impaled on a window pane that hasn't yet
fallen out. To the east the destruction continues down the

showered in chunks of bone and meat, puddles of blood pooling
amongst the wreckage. Shards of glass from a broken window impale
the twisted corpse of an elf to the north wall, the front half of
a reindeer lays beneath him missing its head. A table and two chairs
is set up in the far corner, plates, silverware and cups set out
as if waiting for a regular meal. A steaming roast is prepared and
waiting in the center, a little larger then a normal pig with pointed
ears and two legs, the scent of crispy flesh and spices wafts amongst

exposing the ruins of an elf corpse on one of the tables. Ribs cracked
open, intestines hanging from the ceiling in an awful parody of
christmas garlands and decorations, this elf has had its nose and
mouth replaced with the snout of a reindeer, beady little elf eyes

stacks of reindeer and elf limbs appear to have been torn from their

blood, froth, snow all mixed together to create a frosty masterpiece.
Fingers, toes, and the frozen eye of an elf stares skyward from the

the street, the rest of the reindeer seems to have been sprayed against
the sides of the surrounding buildings, antlers embedded deep in the
forehead of an unlucky elf.

charred black by flame and explosives, the only surviving remanants are
the remains of a christmas tree and a small kitchen oven out of which
the smells of roast reindeer are wafting. The rubble to the south lies

the central chamber, revealing a wide open main floor filled with work benches
and tools. An elf lies with his head crushed in a vice, feet still twitching as
if trying to break free. A row of half made dolls are lined up on a table, each
with the head of an elf sewn on in place of the normal cloth one. A stack of
reindeer corpses lie in a corner, meat exposed to the air, the skins used to
make drums for the toy soldiers lined up in a row. Half wrapped presents are
piled in a corner, bottoms sticky and wet, dripping red into an ever growing
puddle on the floor. 
   To the north an open door reveals an overturned desk and chairs, small flames
