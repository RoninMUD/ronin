In the Month of the Battle, Year 143 of the Second Great Age
of Dark, the Storm Giant King Calaphas visited the realm of
his giant-kin brethren, the Ogres.

The visit was a matter of state, and he was greeted with all
pomp and circumstance by the Ogre King, Urshkank.  Though
relations between the two kingdoms had been strained for
many years, Urshkank had high hopes for the meeting.  He
believed that Calaphas came to extend his hand in friendship,
that the two kingdoms could work together to prosper and
battle against the rising alliance of Elves which threatened
their mutual survival.

Instead what occurred was a betrayal of the worst sort.  As
soon as the meeting had begun and the two were left alone,
Calaphas turned on Urshkank, pinning him beneath his
storm-born gauntlets and choking the life from him.

In the chaos and confusion that followed, Calaphas set fire
to the keep, a signal to those who lay in wait.  Within minutes

Calaphas turned on Urshkank, pinning him beneath his

In the chaos and confusion that followed, Calaphas set fire
to the keep, a signal to those who lay in wait.  Within minutes
an army fo Storm Giants, supported by their sworn enemies,
the Elves of the Mountains, swept in and massacred nearly
the entire Ogre population.

That day, the day of the Great Gods, was the final end of
the mighty kingdom of the Ogres, but it too signaled the
decline of the other giant-kin, and of the mighty Giants
themselves.
