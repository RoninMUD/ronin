Ozymar city is a very horrible place. Ozymar city exists a lot
time already. Me and my friends were searching it for a long time.
They got very good equipments which we were looking for. We tried
to find this city at the forest. Didn't know is lucky or unlucky
we found it. The city was protected by many death traps, there was
only one way to go there. Most of my group members fell into death
traps. When we nearly solved all the death traps, our leader suddenly
fell into another one and dead. We didn't know what to do. There was no
way out, so the rest of us went into the city. I bought a recall there
and recall back to temple, and all my group member died at there.
I have made a cross somewhere at the forest, if you follow my directions
below, you can go to that city, but I am warning you the city is horrible.

  This note seems of utmost importance, as it has the stamp of the
  Queen on it!  It says:
    To Anyone,
      I have lost my birth control pills, and I will reward anyone who
      finds them.  Without them I will have many unwanted children.
      You should be able to find the keys (YES, KEYS) to the castle,
      since none of my servants fight for anything anymore, and one
      of them should be around the store room, where I lost it, so
      examine the area CAREFULLY since the dust is very thick there.
      But who cares about fighting?  I'm a lover, not a fighter.
       The last time I saw the other key was on a barrack dwarf.
  Signed, The Queen.
  PS When you find them, tell Depeche, and he will reward your hard
     work.  You must have all the keys necessary to obtain it, also.

   There are some fun things in here, and if you can't figure them out,
   DO NOT ask a god.  There is a quest involved within here, and your
   first hint is that a dwarf in the barracks is your first clue.  He
   is not willing to share in the prize, so you may have to kill him
   for it.  When you complete the quest, you will be richly rewarded!
   Don't think that it is easy, because it is NOT.  Contact Depeche
   when you have finished the quest, or leave a message on the board.
   PS If you find any bugs, please report them.

This oddly colored book was obviously written by a druid (that probably would
explain the color) and dicusses various trees and such that live in the forest.
One thing that does catch your eye is a chapter about telling which trees are
able to cast spells. Apparently, Eucalyptus trees and the trees that "shiver"
do not cast spells, but the trees that "moan" do.

an Aborigine prince.

nations of elves and the four elemental powers existing combined their might 
to imprison a Demon of Great Evil. They divided their responsibility of it's
safekeeping among themselves. The four keys were dispersed all over the planes,
to the keeping of elemental masters, while the prison itself was to be guarded
by our ancestors. The only sign of the prison is a huge golden door, locked
by means unavailable in our world ... "

	12th of Dwinletton

	He has come to me again, my secret friend. I am so disappointed that I
	can't tell about him to my sisters. He says it would ruin our little
	secret. Always when he comes, he tells me stories of faraway places and
	secret things. I wish I could go with him someday. Today he promised to
	bring me something from afar. We talked late in to the night, and then
	he left, changing in to a handsome black bird, to fly away.

	14th of Dwinletton

	When I awoke in the morning, I found that he had brought me a gift. It
	was wrapped in beautiful black cloth, and was tucked under my pillow.
	I was awfully excited when I opened the red silk ribbon that tied it
	together. There was a gem encrusted knife inside. It was so beautiful.
	I was very happy, for my friend had kept his promise.~

	I had an awful nightmare last night, about huge black things with sharp
	teeth. They came in to the house and killed everyone but me and ...
	oh... I can't bear to remember it again. It was so horrible. I am glad
	it was only a dream. 
	I miss my friend, because he hasn't showed up since the day before 
	yesterday, when he brought the gift.

	17th of Dwinletton

	I had that horrible nightmare again. This time my friend was there too,
	trying to save me by talking to there heinous creatures. And it worked,
	he just talked to them and they went away, to save me. Then suddenly I
	woke up. I don't know what awakened me, but I swear there was something
	in the room with me. I was so scared that I just closed my eyes and 
	pretended to be asleep.

	19th of Dwinletton

	Something awful has happened. I awoke in the middle of the night in a
	dreadful pool of blood. It was everywhere. I ran screaming from my 
	room, but nobody answered. After a while I found my sisters and father,
	but they were all dead. Killed in their sleep. With a knife, and when
	I searched for my knife, it was missing.

	20th of Dwinletton

	I have thought about yesterday, and what happened then. Considering the
	fact that I had 'slept' for almost a day, and my knife was missing, I
	have come to the conclusion that I killed them. There just seems to be
	no other solution. With this load on my conscience, I can't bear it any
	longer. Goodbye, dear diary. God bless.~
