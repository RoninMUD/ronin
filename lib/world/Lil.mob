Snapper Joe~
Snapper Joe is standing here leering at you chillingly

  What an ugly fiend! He is about 6'6'' and has mostly greenish skin with
bright red hair. Half his face is burnt off and he has a perpetual smile.
He is called up from his service in hell in order to aid the Undying One.

An X'ist flesh eater is sitting here munching on some coffin remains

  A large hairy monsterous beast, the only LIVE thing you have seen down
here. It stands approximately 8 feet tall and hunches over to fit in this
small room. It has a pair of tremendous claws that he uses to rip and tear.
It has dog-like face except ...different... Bright glowing eyes and a grimace
lend you to believe that he knew that you were coming...

                       anyone that can hear. The peace of the grave

  Quite insane, the mad etcher has been here it seems for decades...
His hair is white; he babbles nonsense to himself; a layer of dust covers
his out of date clothing; and he seems to be working on the same portion of
the wall near the base...oh and he seems quite blind.

      He leers insanely at you ans says 'heh heh what can I do for you 
children?  Please dont mind my wife, she is always like that...hello
dear can you make some tea for our company? Oh good! Now sit right down
will you? would you like hot or cold tea? Yes the weather is....'

And on he babbles....

She is missing half her head...the one half is smashed in horribly like 
she took a nasty fall. Her one damaged eye hangs on its own. She smiles
insanely at you thru a broken jaw and missing teeth. One hand of hers is 
resting on the shoulder of the etcher...her husband.

carrying and cutting all that meat, but he's gotten pretty fat lately because
his assistants do most of the work for him.  He is carrying a large bloody
cleaver, so it's probably not a good idea to mess with him.
