bracelet~

Count Zarovich truly did love her, a love even mortals could claim to
understand, but she could never see past what he was, and his jealousy
only drove her away. This memento has been worn by Strahd ever since
that fateful day when she plunged from the Ravenloft parapets; the ages
spent upon his wrist have imbued the bracelet with powerful restorative
magic.

band pile veins~

  This band of blood veins has been elaborately braided into an object that
will fit perfectly on your finger.  When you pick it up you can feel some
blood still inside the veins.  You are sure that only someone of pure evil
and in the likeness of a vampire would wear something like this.
