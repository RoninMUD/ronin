The altar consists of several hundred candles.  Many of them are lit,
however, there does not appear to be any sort of pattern discerning
their order.  Above the candles there are twenty little figures, all
of them placed across a giant map of the world.  The figures lie within 
the town of Obervon, the castle which follows it, a few in the city of
Ryujin, and finally a few lie deep within the Tarion Desert.

....Baros's story begins with apparently being the
member of a following known as the "Sunguard's".
From the looks of it him and his following led
countless crusades through the eastern lands.  Once
him and his following deemed the eastern world safe
against the greater evils of his era, they disbanded.
Known for his incredible strength as a templar, he
eventually was recruited by Polo Fay to rid the
world of an animal that is only named as "The
Beast".  From the sounds of it Polo Fay, himself,
and twenty other titans among men banded together
and banished this "Beast" from the mortal plane of
existence forever.  Afterwards it would appear each
of these heroes went their own seperate way.

....Jabon's story begins with a childhood of 
mischief in some unnamed celtic region of the
world.  Apparently he ran away from home, and
somewhere along the way learned the arts of the
bladesinger from the eastern elven city.  Soon, 
he mastered the art of the sword.  From here it
tells of him leaving the town, and taking up jobs
as a sword for hire.  Due to his unique skills and
expert training he apparently was very successful.
Somewhere along the way he came into contact with 
Polo Fay, who sought to assemble a team of 
adventurers to conquer some indominable animal.  
After the whole adventure it mentions him and another
hero known as "Prax" returning to the professional 
soldier lifestyle.

....The story begins with some Zycan Diplomat.
Initially his mission was to make peace with the
Mystic Monestary, and the Monestary near the swamp.
Eventually his influence spread out to nearly all 
temples, monestaries, churches, chapels, mosques, 
etc. However, within these places he began several
underground cults. Abhoraz was sacrificing people with
a special dagger in order to absorb their living
essence and increase his own strength.  His power 
grew beyond that of most demons, and it took countless
crusades against his kindoms to finally defeat him,
however, because of his immense power, they were only
able to trap him within a sphere.  Hundreds of years 
later, Abhoraz was released to fight some awful cur.

with an axe.  His last job as a mercenary entailed him being a bodyguard for a 
prince, whilst him and another prince negotiated terms over who got to marry some
girl. Wilfred, deciding he knew how to resolve the situation, cleaved the woman 
in half, and offered half of her to each prince.  For his crimes he was punished

.                    Summary                     .
....Prax was born in the Roman empire, and into
the life of a professional soldier.  He was trained
in the art of the sword and shield from an early age.
As his life progressed, he discovered an affinity for
magic.  His fellow kinsman began spreading rumors that
he was touched by Pluto, mostly for his unmatched
combat finess, magic, and temper.  However, soon him
and his fellow men of war raged countless campaigns
into the Tarion desert against some god of war.  A
large portion of his life seems to be missing after
this point in time.  It does, however, contain details
of his recruitment by Polo Fay against some ancient
mythical force of nature.  Once his task completed,
he moved to the city of Obervon, forever abandoning
his Roman past.
