bong~
The waterpipe is an admirable piece of workmanship with a large burning
chamber and 9 separate tubes extending from the sturdy assembly fixed to
the table. As you examine the bong closely you notice impressive carvings
on its sides representing some of the finest warriors of Da Doobies.

gargoyle~
A fierce looking creature indeed, it stands watch silently over the fountain
with wings spread and claws at the ready to strike down invaders. It's almost
as if someone had petrified a live gargoyle to make this magnificent work of
art......Hmmmmmm.......
