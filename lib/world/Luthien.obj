gory carcass woman ~
Her blood drenched fair hair, flowing off the altar.
Her empty gaze, staring into the air. The expression
on her once beautiful face, horrified and twisted.
Her once soft and lovely white dress is now but red,
colored by cuts from branches as she fled.
Bloodspattered white skin, cold to the touch,
limbs as stiff as branches, rigor mortis as such.
Her flesh is decaying, although not yet rotten,
her name and her story, is all but forgotten.

The organ appears really old, and sounds as if
its quite out of tune. The huge led pipes rise
towards the ceiling, and dust is blown out when
you play the keys.

You can barely make out the faded letters written
uppon this bloodspattered old piece of paper:
*********************************************************************
*During my research into the cause of my condition I came across    *
*a legend I think may be more than fiction. There is a place...     *
*A dark place... It was during my feverish dreams I first saw a     *
*glimpse of it. The book.. I saw the Fallen One too, he was there.  *
*How splendid he looked! With a fierce piercing gaze he looked       *
*straight at me, and that was when I awoke. Later I read into the    *
*Demonic lore, obsessively looking for clues to the origins of the   *
*book. Now I fear as my condition is worsening, I will not be able to*
*complete it. I have scribbled the neccesary components down onto    *
*this paper in hopes that someone will pick up where I left. My mind *
*is slipping away. I can hear them... Constantly whispering to me... *
