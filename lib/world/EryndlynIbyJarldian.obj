the passage of time in a world that otherwise knew no days and no seasons.
A city appointed mage casts his magical fires into the base of this 
pillar and there, the spell lingers throughout the cycle -- a full day 
on the surface.  At the end of each day, the mage repeats this process 
-- beginning the cycle anew.
