throne grand carved evergreen wood~
The throne is an impressive work of craftsmanship and has stood the test of
time with ease. It is carved from a single massive block of evergreen wood, its
natural beauty flawless in every way. The throne is said to have been crafted
by Odin himself as a gift to Immortalis when the world was forged. As ageless
as its eternal occupant, the throne will likely outlast the world itself.

tablet divine golden gold~
a `kDIVINE GOLDEN TABLET`q~
A `kDIVINE GOLDEN TABLET`q, sent from the heavens, lies here.~
The gods decree that change must come to the world.  After many weeks
of deliberation, the supreme council has effected the following changes:

Healing:

  - The amount healed from spells such as Cure, Lay Hands, and Heal has been 
    increased, granting the wishes of many pious mortals.

  - Miracle will now have a cap of 2000 hit points, as no mortal's faith is
    limitless.
    
  - Great miracle (and the golden stick) will now affect the whole room.
  
  - Divine Intervention will still heal to full, as it is direct divine
    action, like the name implies.
    
  - Spell costs have changed, refer to the help for details.

Skills:

  - Bash and pummel now stack with the victim's current position, allowing
    for even greater damage on the next attack.
    
  - All skills that deal damage will account for the victim's position,
    potentially multiplying their effectiveness.
    
Classes:

  - Bards shall now gain Haste at level 45, and learn the Rejuvenation song
    at level 50.
    
  - Clerics shall now gain the Bash skill at level 35, and gain Haste at 40.

Remorting:
 
  - A new remort system is now in place.  The system is now automated, and
    will incur a cost depending on your current status.  For more information
    refer to 'help remort'.
    
  - After reincarnation, you will be granted a bonus to experience until
    you reach your previous status.
    
  - The gods have chosen a representative, Immortalis, to perform 
    reincarnation.  If you wish to follow this path, he sits to the west of 
    the Temple Altar and Idea board.
