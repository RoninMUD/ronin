planter~
 The planter is a perfect cube of shiny jet-black stone.
Feeling the dirt inside it seems rich and fresh, merely
waiting for a green-thumbed gardener to sow a seed.

bookcases~
 There is an exquisite amount of craftsmanship displayed
in these towering bookshelves. Flowers, trees, animals,
and patterns are carved into the wood with incredible
detail. Hundreds of leather-bound volumes fill the tall
shelves representing history and literature dating back
at least five centuries.

lockbox~
 Upon closer inspection the lockbox is actually made of
a very dark wood which has been reinforced with strong
bands of iron. The cross-shaped keyhole is a bit unusual
but beyond that there's nothing remarkable about it.
