Obsidian Sentinel~
A Large Gargoyle made of Obsidian stands rigid

A hulking mass of blackened stone, its jagged wings glint like broken 
glass. Eyes of molten amber flicker with eerie awareness as it watches 
over the graves it was sworn to guard.

reaver dreadhoof~
Dreadhoof Reaver~
A Monstrous Centaur grunts and walks amongest the tombstones.
~
This towering, undead centaur is a nightmarish fusion of rotting 
flesh and exposed bone, its equine body gaunt and sinewy, its humanoid 
torso twisted with decay. Glowing embers flicker deep within the 
sockets of its sunken eyes, and its breathing is a rasping, hollow 
wheeze, as though it has long since forgotten what it means to be 
alive. The earth beneath its hooves blackens with each step, as if 
rejecting the unnatural horror it has become.

warlord bloodfang~
Bloodfang Warlord~
A Large Hobgolin snears and growls at the slightest movements.
~
A grotesque figure of battle-worn flesh and old scars, this monstrous 
hobgoblin towers over its kin, its mottled skin stretched taut over 
bulging, sinewy muscle. Its jagged maw is locked in a permanent 
sneer, yellowed tusks jutting from cracked lips, and its breath 
carries the acrid stench of old blood. Every twitch of its body is 
brimming with violent energy, as if it is barely restraining the 
savage instinct to tear apart anything that dares stand before it.

Mireborn Horror~
An Undead Troll groans and growls as its flesh falls to ground.
~
A bloated, festering beast that reeks of decay, its sagging flesh 
riddled with open sores. Its oversized limbs end in blackened 
claws, perfect for rending both grave markers and flesh alike.

Duskmare Revenant~
A Spectral Unicorn exudes a decaying aura.
~
This spectral beast moves with an unnatural grace, its obsidian horn 
dripping with a thick, cursed ichor. Where it steps, the grass 
withers, and tombstones crack under the weight of its presence.

harbinger veilborn~
Veilborn Harbinger~
A Large Towering shadow flickers in the dark.
~
A towering specter draped in tattered funeral shrouds, its form 
shifting like smoke caught in an unseen wind. Its hollow face is
a void of swirling darkness, where faint echoes of the long 
forgotten whisper in countless overlapping voices. The air around 
it is unnaturally cold, and with every slow, deliberate 
movement, the shadows beneath it stretch and writhe, reaching 
hungrily toward the living.

Crimson Marquis~
An Old Ancient Vampire flashes its fangs
~
An ancient noble clad in tattered regalia, his once golden eyes 
now sunken pits of hunger. His fanged grin promises suffering, and 
his skeletal fingers twitch with the desire to drain every last 
drop of life from his prey.

mourner hollowed~
Hollowed Mourner~
A Weak Undead is kneeling besides its gravestone.
~
A frail, shrouded figure kneels beside the lone gravestone, whispering 
to something unseen. When disturbed, it rises, revealing a face devoid 
of features. A smooth, empty void that exudes pure sorrow and despair
can be seen beneath its tattered veil.

The Grave Maw~
A large mass of corpses writhes on the ground.
~
A writhing mass of skeletal arms and half-rotted torsos, bound 
together by an unseen force. The creatures moan in unison, clawing 
at the edges of the abyss, desperately trying to pull something up 
from the depths.

The Unspoken~
A large undead draped in cloth wanders through the gravestones
~
A humanoid figure draped in a tattered burial shroud, its body 
shifting and distorting as if struggling to hold a solid form. 
No one remembers its name, and that alone has cursed it to wander 
this forgotten place, attacking any who might leave it behind again.

dowager wailing~
The Wailing Dowager~
An undead figure is sobbing next to her tomb.
~
A spectral figure draped in mourning veils, her translucent hands 
clutching an old, decayed locket. Though her face is hidden, the 
sound of her grief is suffocating. An endless, heart-wrenching sob 
that grows stronger the closer one approaches. When provoked, her 
sorrow turns to rage, her veil lifting to reveal a skeletal visage 
with an unhinged maw that screams with the fury of the abandoned dead.

revenant shrouded~
The Shrouded Revenant~
A corpse wrapped in bandages swiftly moves about the room.
~
A shriveled corpse wrapped tightly in burial wrappings, its movements
unnaturally swift despite its decayed state. It does not walk but 
glides across the mausoleum floor, its bandages unraveling like 
grasping tendrils. The undead seems to whisper in dry, rasping 
voices uttering fragmented prayers of those who were buried here long 
ago. Those ensnared in its grasp risk joining them forever.
