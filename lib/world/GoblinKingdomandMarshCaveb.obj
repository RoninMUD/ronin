This small miner's pick is nothing more than a round wooden shaft with a crude
metal spike attached to one end.  It looks sturdy, if a bit dull, and has
probably seen better days.

ram battering anti-personnel~
This ram was invented by the infamous weapons designer Grug.  It was first used
during the goblin invasion in the year of Pity, though it was used to very
minor success.  The primary problem with the weapon was that it took four
goblins to lift the ram, and every time they managed to skewer someone on the
end, the corpse would get stuck.  The rammers would then have to halt their
charge and spend a few precious minutes trying to cut apart the corpse enough
to extract the ram.  During this time the goblins were grossly undefended and
were usually cut down quite quickly.  The ram was put into retirement a few
hours after its first battle.

catapult attack group launcher~
This catapult was invented as a way for the goblin infantry to contend against
many of the races that have such an advantage because of height.  The 'Up to
Down Division' was created to attack from the air, under cover of a vanguard
infantry attack.  The troops were loaded into the slinging basket at the end
of the arm and then flung forward at an incredible rate.  The flung goblins
wielded dual daggers and wore about 120 pounds of armor, and the entire
process was usually greeted with a loud splattering sound when the troops
dropped from the sky.  The artillery goblins generally did not have more than
one opportunity to make such an attack, but if they did manage to hit
something it would generate quite a mess.  This catapult was retired from
service after the novelty wore off and the goblins began to realize that they
lost more troops this way then during the more-than-common mass retreat.

As unlikely as it seems, someone has managed to fashion a rather
stylish-looking loincloth from nothing but braided reeds and the top of a large
mushroom.  Its looks may be deceiving however, as it appears to be rather moist
and in the process of slowly decaying.  The word "squishy" comes to mind.

Closer inspection of this crude rod reveals a series of primitive carvings
along its length, each depicting different scenes of various giant crabs
scuttling about.  One end, the handle presumably, is thicker than the other,
which crackles with blue electric energy.  Whatever its purpose, it is clearly
magical and probably packs quite a punch.

With very little adjustment, the scales from the forearms of a juvenile black

of the slain dragon still lingers within the hard chitinous material, lending
additional power to the wearer.

This rusty chain shirt has certainly seen better days.  A small, but obvious
hole has been punched in it by some piercing object long ago, probably retiring
its use from its former owner.  There is nothing fancy about its design as it
appears to be standard dwarven military issue.  Though it would offer meager
protection to its wearer, it seems to still retain a trace amount of some old
magical enchantment.

helm heavily-rusted rusted horned~
The helm used to be a simple metal skull cap, with a pair of ivory horns
attached to the top, but is of little protective use now.  One of the horns has
been cloven in half, a large dent near the crown of the helm can be seen and
the entire metal surface is covered in a fine layer of rust.  It is said that
these types of helms were often held on with a leather strap and used by battle
dwarves as an extra head-butting weapon; this leads one to question whether the
large dent was caused by the wearer's opponent, or the wearer himself.
