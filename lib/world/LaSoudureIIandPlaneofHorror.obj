key~
 This crooked key has been forged in some dark place; the metal is unlike any
you have seen before, it is ice cold and you cannot help shake the feeling that
touching it has infected you with a suffocating darkness on a spiritual level.
The key is shaped like a crooked cross, or an X depending on how you turn it.
From the key ring of the Grim Reaper himself it fell, never meant to fall into
the hands of mere mortals like you...

fragment~
 There is an immense amount of energy contained in this small
crystal fragment and you feel ill at ease holding it in your
hand. Just the memory of the terrors this stone helped birth
in the Plane of Horrors is enough to cause you to shiver.

shard~
 Shadowy movements from within the crystalline shard cause dark
ripples across the brilliant green surface. Planar beings tore
the soul from the once immortal gods of the realm, spawning the
abominations that now stalk the Plane of Horrors. An incredible
wealth of power lies within the shard containing these severed
soul remnants, but how to harness it?
