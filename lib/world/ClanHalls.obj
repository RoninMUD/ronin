Undulating as if an entire ocean is contained within its

Though without texture, the silvery orb is cold to the

transparent and for an instant you catch a glimpse of a

carving stone sane~
  The huge statue completely dominates the atmosphere in this enormous hall.
The statue is split straight down the middle, with the right half depicting
a tall man wearing a suit and a leather shoe.  In his right hand he holds a
keyboard, and he carries a burdened and dark apathic facial expression, his
sad eyes staring straight down onto the floor.  The left half depicts a god
amongst men, ruler of the heavens, creator of unimaginable things beyond
mortal comprehension.  His body is wrapped in a shredded straightjacket and
his left leg rests firmly at the roots of the mother tree Yggdrasil.  His
fiery gaze stares down onto Midgaard in rejoice.  In his left hand he holds
a glowing gem, which is said to contain what the elders simply refer to as
"the code".
There is a mithril inscription at the base of the statue.
The inscription reads:
Sane giveth, and Sane taketh away.
