E
valentine~
This valentine is very finely crafted. It is made of bright red paper
cut into a heart shape, with small pink and purple hearts all around
the inside of the large red one. The outside edges are trimmed with
fine white lace. It has a soft, satiny feel to it. Whoever sent this
must care for you very deeply!

it. It looks like it could still be opened.

recipe parchment~

 How this came into Pluto's possession is an epic tale of infighting
among the immortals of Olympus. Globules of hardened wax splattered
on the parchment suggest that Daedalus had a hand in the mischief.
 The disorganized blue scrawl is littered with incomplete words and
scribbled nonsense. Four distinct, separate groups of lettering seem
to glow with a brilliant azure, standing out clearly against the dull
blue ink covering the rest of the parchment.
