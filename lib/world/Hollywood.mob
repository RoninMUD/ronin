A Skinny Goblin ~
A skinny and very frightned looking goblin
~
This goblin is so skinny that you almost have to stifel a laugh.
Upon further inspection you notice some scraches, cuts and bruses
scatterd about the flesh of this poor creature. The first thing that
comes to mind is that this humanoid was the subject of some cruel test.
