page57~
When Timur was born, I flew into a rage. How could we have been
so foolish as to dismiss the evil witch Quaratt's curses as mere
foolishness? Especially Scratch Mama! She was a priestess to the 
dark panther goddess! We should have known better.
   After I calmed down, I began to scheme. Eighty years of being
the best tracker and trapper in the known world are not achieved
by brute strength and a thick head, no. I realized the thing Quaratt
feared the most was captivity, so I knew what I had to do. I left
Scratch Mama and Timur here at home and went south with Tomek. Oh,
I knew where to look. The cat-bitch had moved to another part of
the jungle, but nobody has ever escaped Lemouro, no. Not even a
goddess could escape my talents.
   The bitch put up a hell of a fight, but Tomek held her minions
off long enough for me to net Quaratt. I placed her in the hold
of Kiri-Khan's ship and went back to the jungle with Tomek.

page58~
   I had heard on my last journey to Southern Vilosia of another
local god. One thing about those southern tribes, they don't worship
fables. I knew this monster had to exist somewhere, and the Illiki
Tribe would know where.
   I came to them asking about the white ape. I suppose my memory
has gotten a bit rusty in fifty years, but they eventually told me
that I was a crazy old man and that there was no white ape, only
Khallaq, the Fish Ape. I accepted that with difficulty and a few
Illiki corpses. Nobody tells me I'm a senile old man.
   The chief finally calmed me down enough to tell me where the
mighty Khallaq's altar was. Altars in the jungles tend to be close
to the gods, as they are generally too lazy to travel far for their
meat. This was no exception.
  I set traps around the small pool where the primitive altar was,
and had Tomek guard me from downwind, I didn't want this ape beast
just hiding out for years. It hid for only four days. The battle
~
E
page59~
was great, but Khallaq was a prize worth keeping. I couldn't bear
to skin such a magnificent beast, so I placed him also in Kiri-
Khan's hold.
   Tomek had caught a few new scents in the jungle, so I captured
a few more creatures to bring back with me, for the wife.
  When I finally got home with my prizes, our shack in the woods
had been destroyed by my fledgeling son. Seeking a place where
we could raise our poor child in peace, I found a massive underground
tunnel system near a glacier. I built cages for my prizes and
a small cabin for my family. There were a few problems with a local
sorcerer called Hakeem, but I showed him my knowledge of the fearsome
Warek Beasts, which he called Fur Beasts, and he was grateful enough
to not bother me. It seems, however, that he has ensorcelled the
entrance to my home. I hope he does not think to hold Lemouro the
Tracker at bay, for I am much older and wiser than he.
