mask silver~
This is one of the finest pieces of dwarven craftmanship you have ever
seen. Constructed of the purest silver, this mask reflects even the smallest
of lights into a brilliant display.  Oddly enough though, the inside of the
mask seems to emanate a subtle blue glow, almost as if it was exposed to some
kind of radiation.

sword silver broadsword flame~
A fine example of elvish craftsmanship, this sword of silver is both
elegant and deadly.  However, the entire length of the blade is 
engulfed in a flickering blue flame, and that is definitely not the
work of elves.
