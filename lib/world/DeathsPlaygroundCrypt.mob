sentinel boneguard skeleton undead~
Boneguard Sentinel~
A rusted yet imposing skeletal knight stand here.
~
A sworn protector of the crypts sacred dead, but in undeath, it has
become a relentless enforcer of its forgotten oath. Its hollow eyes 
burn with faint blue embers, remnants of the soul that refuses to 
rest, and the faded crest of a long extinct kingdom is barely visible 
beneath the grime of centuries. It moves with slow, measured precision
down the cold stone corridors. Though it no longer speaks, an eerie 
clanking of its bones fills the air as it marches forward, ready 
to strike down any who disturb the silence of the tomb.

archer hollow skeleton undead~
Hollow Archer~
A tattered leather-clad skeleton holding a bow.
~
The silent executioner of the crypt, a lifeless 
marksman who stalks the corridors in eternal vigilance. Though its 
flesh has long decayed, its skeletal frame moves with the same 
fluid grace it once had in life, drawing spectral arrows from a 
quiver that never empties. Each shot carries the whispering voices
of the dead, a haunting echo of the archers fallen comrades, and 
wounds inflicted by its arrows fester with a necrotic curse. It does 
not chase its preythere is no need. Once it has set its gaze 
upon a target, the hunt is already over.

legionnaire cursed skeleton undead~
Cursed Legionnaire~
The remnants of a disciplined warrior, clad in cracked and rusting plate.
~
The Legionnaire is the revenant of a long dead soldier, its oaths
binding it to duty even beyond the grave. Though its bones are 
brittle and its armor worn with age, it moves with the drilled 
precision of an elite warrior, executing practiced formations as 
though leading an invisible battalion. In battle, it strikes with 
calculated aggression, blocking blows with its shield before 
retaliating with brutal efficiency. A cursed sigil, etched into its 
chest plate, radiates a sickly green glow, ensuring that even in 
destruction, the Legionnaire may rise again, reforged in undeath 
to fight once more.

magus soulflame skeleton undead sorcerer~
Soulflame Magus~
A skeletal sorcerer wreathed in flickering blue fire.
~
Here stands a being of raw, lingering arcane power, its body 
consumed by spectral fire that has long since replaced its 
flesh. Though bound to the crypt by unseen forces, its magic 
has not faded with time
rather, it has grown more potent, its 
mastery of necrotic sorcery now unhindered by the constraints 
of mortality. With each flick of its bony fingers, ghostly fire 
bursts forth, searing the soul rather than the flesh, leaving 
behind wounds that cannot heal. It moves as though suspended 
between realms, gliding just above the ground, its presence 
warping the very air around it. Those who hear its whispered 
spells often find themselves haunted long after they escape 
its grasp.

executioner revenant skeleton undead~
Revenant Executioner~
A towering, hooded skeletal figure.
~
This undead looks like death incarnate, a towering specter of 
judgment and brutality. Draped in a tattered, bloodstained 
cloak, it moves with slow, deliberate steps, its heavy axe 
carving deep gouges into the stone floor as it advances. It 
does not speak, nor hesitate with its movements.

phantom wailing undead specter~
Wailing Phantom~
A drifting, translucent specter of sorrow.
~
A tormented spirit, bound to the crypt by unfinished regrets and 
unbearable loss. Though it barely resembles the form it had in 
life, its agony is unmistakable. Its distorted visage constantly 
twisting in an expression of endless despair. It floats silently 
through the corridors until disturbed, at which point it releases 
a wail so devastating that the very air seems to fracture under 
its sorrow.

ghoul tomb rot undead~
Tomb Rot Ghoul~
A hunched and festering monstrosity stares intently ahead.
~
The ghoul is a walking disease, a rotting nightmare cursed to endlessly 
hunger for the flesh of the living. Its decayed body is swollen with 
putrid filth, its skin peeling away in slick, necrotic layers that 
ooze a bile so toxic that even the stone beneath its feet blackens 
and crumbles. Despite its grotesque appearance, it moves with terrifying 
speed, lunging at prey with claws that slice through armor like 
paper, their wounds festering instantly with a sickness that spreads 
through the body like wildfire.

Bonewraith~
A ghostly entity bound to its own skeletal remains
~
The tormented remnant of a warrior who refused to leave its mortal 
shell, its soul still tethered to its own remains by chains of grief 
and fury. It shifts constantly between the realms of the living and 
the dead, its body phasing in and out of existence as it hunts those 
who dare to intrude upon its resting place. Its sharp claws flash in
the light.

priest mummy undead~
Mummified High Priest~
An ancient priest wrapped in decayed ceremonial robes.
~
Once a devoted servant of the divine, the priest has become a mockery
of its former faith, its body preserved not by sacred rites, but by 
the malevolent will of the crypt itself. Its hollow sockets glow with 
a dim, unholy light as it mutters prayers in a language long lost to 
time, each word laced with a curse that drains the strength of those 
who hear it. The air around it is thick with the scent of ancient 
incense, masking the underlying stench of decay.

revenant plague undead corpse~
Plague Revenant~
A wretched, disease ridden corpse
~
Once a victim of a terrible blight, the body has become something far 
worse. An eternal carrier of undeaths most insidious affliction. Its
rotting body is bloated with disease, pustules weeping dark ichor as 
it moves with agonizing slowness. Where it treads, the ground itself 
blackens and dies, the very air poisoned by the noxious fumes that 
seep from its gaping mouth.

horror graveborn undead~
Graveborn Horror~
A monstrous fusion of skeletal remains and twisted sinew
~
A large eldritch abomination, a being of countless dead, fused 
together by necromantic blasphemy. Its body is a writhing mass 
of bones, sinew, and tattered flesh, its multiple skulls eternally 
locked in silent screams. Each limb is an unnatural graft, stitched 
together by something far older and crueler than mere mortal magic. 
When it moves, it does so in fits and starts, as though struggling 
to control its many parts, yet its attacks are devastatingly precise. 
When it feeds, its body swells, incorporating the remains of the fallen 
into its grotesque form, growing ever larger with each new victim.

Lichbound Acolyte~
A skeletal devotee clad in tattered ceremonial robes.
~
The undead was once a zealous disciple of a powerful necromancer, its 
loyalty so absolute that even death could not sever its servitude. 
Though its flesh has long rotted away, its mind remains intact, bound 
to the arcane whispers of its eternal master. It moves with deliberate 
purpose, chanting dark invocations in a dead tongue that causes the very 
air to tremble.

colossus ossified undead bones fused~
Ossified Colossus~
A towering mass of fused bones
~
Formed from the remains of countless fallen warriors, it is an 
amalgamation of skulls, ribs, and broken limbs, held together by 
sheer necromantic will. Standing over three times the height of a 
man, it moves with terrifying inevitability, each footstep sending 
tremors through the crypts ancient foundations. Its arms, formed 
from the fused bones of dozens of limbs, swing like wrecking 
balls, shattering stone and steel alike with raw, unrelenting 
force.

nerath boneclutch undead ruler~
Nerath Boneclutch~
A nightmarish amalgamation of skeletal remains
~
Once a powerful necromancer, Nerath Boneclutch transcended death not 
through mastery, but through grotesque obsession, his own decaying 
body becoming the vessel for countless souls trapped in his insatiable 
hunger. Now, he is a shifting horror of bone and shadow, his form ever
changing, limbs stretching and twisting as though formed from the 
remains of those he has consumed. His voice is a whisper of many 
voices, each word laced with the suffering of the damned, taunting 
intruders with knowledge they should never hear. The air around him 
feels heavier, as though reality itself recoils from his 
presence, and those who meet his gaze feel an unbearable chill 
seep into their very souls. Few who encounter him escape, and those 
who do are forever changed, haunted by the echoes of the crypt.

Tomb Stalker~
A skeletal predator with elongated limbs and piercing crimson eyes
~
A monstrous undead sits before you. Its skeletal form has been warped 
by dark forces, its arms and legs stretched into unnatural lengths. 
Its fingers ending in long, razor-like talons. It moves with a 
disturbing, insect-like grace, crawling along walls and ceilings in 
absolute silence. Its glowing red eyes fixed upon those who dare venture 
too deep.
