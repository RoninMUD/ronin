On the Edge of the Huge Dreadful Swamp~
   You are standing on the edge of the huge dreadful swamp. All around you,
strange smells and grotesque noises arise. The brown muck squishes and
squirts with each motion made. Mosquitos and flies buzz about, making the
air feel alive with their presence. Old rumor says that many adventurers
haven't come back once they have entered the swamp. There is a sign planted
deep in the swampy grasses.

In the depths of this swamp, many adventurers have found their doom.
Do NOT enter this place if you aren't ready to fight against the most
fearsome, but fair, monsters. This means you people under level 20.

wet all the time. The smell of swamp gases seems to overwhelm your nostrils
with each breath. Tall green shoots rise from the muddy ground, each one
reaching to the sky.

   You are on a path through the swamp. As you look down towards your feet,
you see that your legs and feet have become splattered with the muck of the
swamps juices. Water, sand, and mud seem to stretch as far as you can see. In
the distance, the sound of a bird wafts through to your ears. The silent
slithering of sounds adds to the mystery of this place.

a good footing, you suddenly start to sink. The more you struggle to leave,
the more stuck you get. Probably should have used your toe to check the
ground first, but alas, the muck of the swamp begins to surround your head,
and your body ceases to breath.

place, you begin to realize without a doubt, just how alive this place is.
The path leads deep into the swamps, deep into the unknown.

   You are on a path made of stone. In the tiny crevasses, you glimpse small
greenery slowly reaching out into the light of the sun. As look along the
edge of the path, you can see where someone has placed honeysuckle flowers.
The delicious scent of fresh baked goods floats through the air.

The End of a Back Alley~
   You are at the end of a back alley. Bright light and some noises come
from above you. Strong vines reach into the sky, curling and curving. You
can see other adventurers, as well as friends you have known for what would
feel like forever. You become cautious to such illusions, or perhaps it is
exactly what it appears to be. Home.

In the Web of the King Spider~
   You are in the web of the King Spider. In all directions wisps of thread
hang and stretch. It would seem the true paths are shown by their ability
to hold more weight at a time. A silky mist hampers at the edge of the web,
giving it more of a surreal appearance.

In the Web of the King Spider~
   You are in the web of the King Spider. Slim silvery threads hold together
the path which you walk upon. Deep within the strands, you can see how the
threads cocoon together, forming bits and pieces of living space for the
spiders which live within the Spider King's realm.

As you get sucked under, a snake sinks its venomous fangs into your thigh.
You will soon be dead.

The Lair of the King Spider~
   You are in the lair of the Spider King. The lair is twined with twisted
gray web. The walls are soft and no one will hear how loud the victims of
the Spider King scream. Soft curtains are hanging on the western wall.
Twists and twirls of golden and silver thread dangle from the ceiling.

Ant Town Armory~
   Miniature suits of armor lean against the walls on their respective
shelves. Helms and shirts made from the finest metals gleam within the
light of the store. A small table sits near one side of the wall, boasting
a fat little ant, ready to help should you need him.

Ant Town Magic Shop~
   Potions and lotions, scrolls and spells. This shop seems to hold all of
that and more. A tiny woman sits on a stool, weaving and constructing her
spells of many, preparing them for sale. As she peers up to see if you need
her assistance, the tiny spectacles on her nose slip, giving her the allure
of a grandmotherly soul.

Inside the Broken Old Well~
   You are inside the old well. The bottom is dry and full of garbage. The
scent of decay and death assaults you, as you realize there is no way out.
You could scream, but there is no possible way anyone could rescue you from
this. Perhaps next time you look down into a dark hole, you will think of
your exit before jumping on in. See you in the afterlife.

Tiny ants at the bottom of the well assault your face, enter your body,
and begin consuming your vital organs.
