AREA AREAS

The following help entries are available.  They range
from area standards to rewards for area creation and
reviewing.

"AREA STANDARDS"
"AREA WRITING"
"AREA SPECS"
"AREA REVIEW"
"AREA POINTS"

#
"AREA POINTS"

Area points only exist on gods and can be redeemed
for extra stats on a mortals equipment.

50  area points - 1 damroll + 1 hitroll
75  area points - 1 damroll + 2 hitroll
100 area points - 2 damroll + 2 hitroll

Hit/damroll would be placed on gear that is less than 2
hit/damroll above the loading value.  Basically that
means an onyx ring could at best be 5/5 after stat addition.
The hitroll/damroll cannot be split among items and are
non-transferable.

Enchanted items like claws are excluded since they start at 0/0.
Due to code and player structure restrictions, the additions
can not be placed in the 3rd apply location.

#
"AREA REVIEW"

Any area reviewer gets a base amount of 25 area points.
If the review is easy and it doens't need to be re-reviwed,
that would be it.  However, if changes had to be reviewed,
additional area points will be given.

All areas are subject to a final review by a senior admin, 
and if the initial review wasn't done correctly, area points
can be recalled from the initial reviewer.  A normal final review
is supposed to be a rubber stamp of approval and will give an
award of 10 area points.  

A person doing both initial and final review would only get
the award for the initial review.

#
"AREA SPECS"

The coder writing area specs for an area will be awarded with
up to 25 area points.  The award is proportional depending on
the number/type of specs and if the specs have to be fixed/cleaned
up, some of the points will be reallocated.

#
"AREA STANDARDS"

The minimum room description length isn't 5 lines.
If you can say what you need to in 3 lines, its acceptable.
Of course having an entire area with only 3 line rooms
isn't what we want.  Just put the words where they
are most useful.

Cloned rooms while not desired can be accepted in
certain circumstances.  This includes rooms which are
part of a maze or describe something thats pretty
static for 2-3 rooms.  Whats not acceptable is a 100
room area with 7-8 different room descriptions.

All areas will be broken up into a maximum of 50 room
sections. That means if you're planning a 100 room
area, you need to think of a way to split it in two 
and get part 1 installed before even starting on part 
2.  This will prevent writer burnout and if you never 
start part 2, we'll at least have part 1.

#
"AREA WRITING"

Area writers will earn area points depending on the complexity
of the area.  A good rule of thumb is that the creator will
be awarded with an area point for each room in the area.
There is however a minimum of 50 rooms and there must obviously
be mobs and objects.  A maze in an area is less work for
descriptions, so a 100 room area with 50 rooms of a maze would
probably get a reward near that of 75 rooms.

New areas that are seen to be of outstanding quality could
gain the area creator some bonus area points.

Area revamps which involve rewriting a good percentage of the
area descripts will be awarded at a rate of 1 area point for
every 2 rooms.

Area updates which will mostly require some stat changing and 
maybe an extra piece of gear will be awarded minimal area points 
and only be considered if there is some amount of work involved.

QUESTS

Post your quests that you've done to the quest board west

keep piling up, that player will not be permitted to run
quests until the prizes are awarded.

SOS SETOBJSTAT

 Level: IMP

 Usage: sos <object> <opt 1> <opt 2> <opt 3>

 This command changes the stats of the target object.  There are
 many options to this command and it can get a little complicated.

 Option 1 - can be numeric (1-12) or be a specific affect.

 Option 2 - always the value.

 Option 3 - is only used when option 1 is a specific affect.  Option 3 can be 0,
            1 or 2.  0 indicates the affect is the first affect on the object, 1
            indicates it is the second affect, 2 indicates the third affect.

 Option 1
    1 - (type) type flag
    2 - (extra) extra flags (ex: sos item 2 LIMITED) WIZHELP FLAGS (or bitnum)
    3 - (wear) wear flags   (ex: sos item 3 HEAD)    WIZHELP FLAGS (or bitnum)
    4 - (value0) value 0    (values depend on type flag)
    5 - (value1) value 1    (WIZHELP VALUES to see a chart)
    6 - (value2) value 2
    7 - (value3) value 3
    8 - (weight) weight
    9 - (cost) cost
   10 - (cost_day) cost/day
   11 - (affected) aff_bits (ex: sos item 11 FURY) WIZHELP FLAGS (or bitnum)
   12 - (owner)
   13 - (timer) timer
   14 - (popped) day popped
   15 - (specvalue) spec_value

   For 2, 3 and 11, the bit is added if it isn't on the object and removed 
   if it is.
   
   Other examples:
     sos <item> wear head
     sos <item> extra limited
     sos <item> cost_day 1000
