...This just in!
Spotted in Santa's Workshop: A town press and newspaper boy.
Rumors have it that this news function will become obsolute.

...Areas
The swamp, and other new and old areas will be added soon. Other things
have come up that put it off.  Rent for one.

...Rent
Rent basically works now.  There might be an occasional bug, due to the 
patch work of the code.  If you encounter one, please report to a God.

...New Features
If you have any complaints, suggestions, etc on the new features, please
feel free to post your views on a board.
