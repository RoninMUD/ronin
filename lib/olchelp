SHOPS

Commands
--------
create shop # - Create shop
edit shop # - Edit shop
sdelete # - Delete the shop
zshow s <zone #> - Lists shops in the zone
stat s # - Stat the shop

When creating a shop it is important to remember these guidelines.

- The shop number and keeper number are the same.
- The keeper must be loaded in the room specified in the shop file.
- Any items the keeper is to sell must be loaded in the keepers inventory.
- If the item should always load, set the repop rate to 100.
- Any items the keeper supplies in unlimited quanities must be specified
  in the shop file.
- A shop can only produce up to 5 items in unlimited quantities.
- Text for keeper speech must be preceeded with %s.
- Text with gold amounts can include %d for the amount.
- Reloading a zone without saving will overwrite any changes to the shop.

Details about the variables in the shop are included in the edit shop
command.

#
SKIN

Skins can be made from corpses using the skin command.
When a character skins a corpse, whatever is in the corpse,
the skin of the corpse and perhaps some hidden objects
in the corpse are placed in the room.  A skin can then
be traded into the fur trader in Midgaard in exchange
for cash.

The skin trading is meant to replace putting golds on
mobs that logically wouldn't have gold.

The hidden object part can be used to replace the zone
commands for give and equip.  When creating the mob
you can assign up to 5 virtual numbers of objects that
might load when the corpse of that mob is skinned.  The
chance of the item loading is the objects repop percent.

Commands to edit mob skins are

mskin # value/load1/load2/load3/load4/load5 #
edit m # skin value/load1/load2/load3/load4/load5 #

#
BOARD

You can create a TEMPORARY board for your area to make notes
to yourself as you build.

Simply create the obj, edit o # type BOARD
and its now a board.

If you want to set min read write and remove levels
just edit the values of the board object.

#
RANDOM

Any object with this flag will load with variable
stats added/subtracted from its base stats.

Random stats are Hps, Mana, Move, Damroll, Hitroll
and Armor.

Hps/Mana/Move/Armor will add/subtract +5 to -5.
Damroll/Hitroll will add/subtract +2 to -2.

For example a ring with base stats of +1 +1
hitroll/damroll could load with -1 to +3 hitroll
and -1 to +3 damroll.

#
DECAY

Any object with the DECAY flag will slowly decay
over time until its timer his 0, then the object
disappears.

To set the decay timer use the command

edit o <num> timer <amt>.

While equipped the object decays 2 points/tick.
While in inventory, on the ground or in another
object, the object decays 1 point/tick.

While in rent, in a vault or carried/equipped
by a mob, the object doesn't decay.

"EDIT ROOM"

Room editables are:
flags, extradescription, sector, name, description, direction, reset

SEE ALSO: DIRECTIONS SECTORS "ROOM FLAGS" "ROOM EXTRADESC" ROOMS

#
"DIRECTIONS"

To be able to pass from one room to another it must have exits connecting
them.  You will be able to hear if anyone dies in a room that connects with
the one you are in even if no exit leads there.  Note that if you want to
open or close doors you need to add it into the reset file.

Usage:
 edit room <#> direction <n|e|w|s|u|d> add/remove <room#> (to add/remove exit)
 edit room <#> direction <n|e|w|s|u|d> change room <room#> (to change exit)
 edit room <#> direction change key <key obj# | none>
 edit room <#> direction <n|e|w|s|u|d> change type <normal|door|nopick|jump|
move|crawl|climb|enter|lock_10/15/20/25/30>

Exit types:

set the exit type to MOVE and players type move <keyword>
to open the exit.  These exits can only be closed, and are not
lockable.  Think of them as a door.

exit types JUMP, CRAWL, CLIMB and ENTER  the player types
jump/crawl/climb/enter <keyword> to move through the exit.
These exit types are totally invisible, and the room desc.
would need to hint that the exit exists.

See ROOMS for a list of alternate direction editting commands.

"CONTAINERS"

edit o # value <max contain> <how locked> <key number>

Where how locked is a comb of....
CONT_CLOSEABLE      1
CONT_PICKPROOF      2
CONT_CLOSED         4
CONT_LOCKED         8
so for CLOSEABLE, PICKPROOF, CLOSED and locked the value is 15


#
"EDIT ZONE"

A zone can have four modes: always (resets when lifespan is up), empty (resets
when no PC is in the zone), never (only resets at bootup) or blocked (doesn't
even load at bootup).

The lifespan of a zone can be set with 'edit z <#> command life <lifespan>'

To reset a zone fully (all items will load regardless of repop value) you
can use 'edit z <#> reset full'.

It's not wise to mess around with any of the other reset commands like 'name'
or 'range', those are for administration purposes only.

Reset commands:
edit zone <#> command add <#> M <if flag> <mob #> <max allowed> <room #>
edit zone <#> command add <#> F <if flag> <mob #> <max allowed> <room #>
edit zone <#> command add <#> R <if flag> <mob #> <max allowed> <room #>
edit zone <#> command add <#> E 1         <obj #> <max allowed> <pos(0-17)>
edit zone <#> command add <#> G 1         <obj #> <max allowed>
edit zone <#> command add <#> T <if flag> <obj #> <max allowed> <room #>
edit zone <#> command add <#> O <if flag> <obj #> <max allowed> <room #>
edit zone <#> command add <#> P 1         <obj #> <max allowed> <into obj#>
edit zone <#> command add <#> D <if flag> <room#> <direction  > <state(0-2)>
edit zone <#> command <add|change|delete> [arguments]
edit zone <#> mode <always|empty|never|block>
edit zone <#> <command|life|mode|name|creators|range|reset> [arguments]

Zone commands can be added in any order you like.  The code will insert new
commands into the file and not overwrite the older ones.

#
"DOORS"

Usage: edit z <#> com add <#> D <if flag> <room#> <direction> <state(0-2)>
 Directions are 0=north, 1=east, 2=south, 3=west, 4=up and 5=down.
 State is 0=open, 1=closed, 2=locked and closed.

#
"ZRESET"

To:
 load a mob:               (M)ob    <if flag> <mob #> <max> <room#>
 make a mob follow:        (F)ollow <if flag> <mob #> <max> <room#>
 make a mob ride:          (R)ide   <if flag> <mob #> <max> <room#>
 equip a mob               (E)quip     1      <obj #> <max> <pos(0-17)>
 give a mob an item:       (G)ive      1      <obj #> <max>
 take an item :            (T)ake   <if flag> <obj #> <max> <room#>
 drop an item :          Dr(O)p     <if flag> <obj #> <max> <room#>
 put an item into another: (P)ut       1      <obj #> <max> <into obj#>
 manipulate doors:         (D)oor   <if flag> <room#> <direction> <state(0-2)>

Care needs to be taken with the order of commands, i.e. you need to place the
reset commands to equip, give, follow and ride immediately after the mob you
wish to manipulate.

#
"LOCK LEVELS" "LOCK TYPES"

lock_10/15/20/25/30
   The player needs an ITEM_LOCKPICK to pick these, more on that
   later.  However, if a player has one, the chances of picking a lock
   of your level is 50%.  Example Lock_15 level 15 thief = 50% If you
   than the lock % is lower.  Example lvl 5 player lock_30 = 1%.

Still remember to load a key for the doors on a mob somewhere, and if
you want the players to HAVE to kill a mob to get the key, use NOPICK.

The item LOCKPICK works like a wand.  When you create this item (if you
feel you need to have more lockpicks in the game), you specify number of picks
on it and the max number of picks.  At a failed pick, the lockpick loses
some strength and if the number of 'charges' reaches 0, the lockpick
disintegrates.  A successful pick will restore the lockpick to its original
condition.
The lockpick item was necessary to prevent level 10s from doing #100 pick door
on level 30 locks. Warriors can knock a lock up to level 20 and they don't need
lockpicks, just move points.


#
"OBJECT WEIGHT"

Each object has a weight value.  It is used to determine how much a character
is carrying and if he is strong enough to wield a weapon of a certain weight.
The Strength statistic needed to wield weapons are as follow.

"WINDOWS" "ROOM WINDOWS"

This feature is attached to both object and room extradescriptions. Here's
basically how it works.

edit <r/o> # extra add <keyword>
]room #
]@
When the player types look <keyword> they see the room whose number was
placed in the extradescription.

#
"AC APPLY" "ARMOR APPLY"

AC apply for various wear positions (excluded positions apply the value
they are given)

Lights: cant add ac (unless as an ARMOR affect)
Finger: 0
Body: 3x the value (3 ac is actually 9 ac, etc)
Shield: 2x the value
Wrists: 0

#
"DESCRIPTIONS" "OBJECT DESCRIPTIONS" "MOB DESCRIPTIONS"

Object descs:

Name: These are the keywords of an object, its usually a good idea to make
the first word of the name field the noun of what the object is (f.x hammer)
end name keywords with a @@ on the same line.

Short: Name that appears when an item is in inventory or equipped, also
must end with a @@ on the same line.

Long: Description you see when an item is on the ground, end with a @@ on
same line also.

Mob descs:

Name: Same as with objects, ettin should precede large, etc. End with @@
on same line.

Short: Desc you see while fighting or when someone forces the mob to gossip
*grin* Best to add 'a' to the beginning of it so when in combat it looks
more natural ---> you make a Large Ettin think twice..... End with @@ on
same line.

Long: Desc you see when you first enter a room and the mob is just
standing there. End it with a @ on a blank line.

Full: Desc you see when you look at the mob. End with @ on a blank line.

#

when wielded by that class.

Note: some mob classes are split into LESSER and GREATER types.  A weapon
which affects the GREATER type will also affect the LESSER type, while the
reverse isn't true.
