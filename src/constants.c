 3 Wednesday = Óðinsdagr                       = Odin's Day           = Day of the Old God     - Liberty taken here, converting Odin to "old god", as Odin was the god of many things.

 6 Saturday  = Laugardagr                      = Bath/Washing Day     = Day of the Spirits     - Literally "bath" or "washing" day. Note: Made up a Ronin-specific day, as nothing bath-related sounded good.
